Quantifier/Intensifier tests
============================

(1) a.   nanga kivo  ipan/ekeng
         house small extremely/too
         ‘extremely/too small house’

    b. * nanga kivo  nay ipan
         house small and extremely
         Intended: ‘*extremely and small house’

    c. * nanga kivo  ipan      nay ekeng
         house small extremely and too
         Intended: ‘*extremely and too small house’

(2) a.   nanga kivo  kay/diring
         house small three/several
         ‘three/several small houses’
        
    b. * nanga kivo  nay kay
         house small and three
         Intended: ‘*small and three houses’
        
    c. * nanga kivo  kay   nay diring
         house small three and several
         Intended: ‘*three and several small houses’

(3) a.   nanga kivo  (ipan)    nā
         house small extremely my
         ‘my (extremely) small house’

    b. * nanga kivo  nay nā
         house small and my
         Intended: ‘*my and small house’

    c. * nanga kivo  ipan      nay nā
         house small extremely and my
         Intended: ‘*my and extremely small house’

(4) a.   nanga kivo  malan diring
         house small dozen several
         ‘several dozen small houses’

         → malan ‘dozen’ is a numeral, though!

    b. * nanga kivo  diring  menikaneng
         house small several another
         Intended: ‘another several small houses’

    b.   nanga-ikan patu         kivo
         house=many surprisingly small
         ‘surprisingly many small houses’

    c.   nanga kivo  sam/diring  nā
         house small two/several my
         ‘several of my/my two small houses’

* Qs cannot be coordinated with adjectives, adverbs or possessive determiners
* Qs cannot be coordinated with each other
* Qs can be modified by adverbs, but not by other Qs
* Qs and possessives can cooccur

=> Qs are not ADJs, and neither are possessives
=> Qs are not adverbs, just like possessives aren't adjectives
=> Qs logically can't be compared (*severaler, *severalest; *veryer, veryest),
   unlike descriptive adverbs. OTOH, sentence adverbs also can't be compared
   (*basicallier, *basicalliest).
=> Qs must form a phrase with Q as a head (whether that is a free morpheme or
   expressed by a clitic) because they can be modified
=> Qs can't iterate and probably can't be recursive, so specifiers?
=> So possibly like (5), then?

       +-                                  -+

=> "Complements of functional categories are f-structure coheads" (Bresnan et
   al. 2016: 105), so N is a co-head of D, which means N and D share the same
   functional core, thus not 'my <(↑OBJ)>' but normal 'house <(↑POSS)>',
   because "my" as a functional head modifies "house" as a lexical head.

* On the other hand, what to do with clitic quantifiers which are modified by 
  adverbs (?) in place

(6) a.   nanga kivo  kagan
         house small far.too
         ‘far too small house’

    b. ? nanga kivo-ikan  kagan
         house small=very far.too
         ‘?far too very small house’

    c. ! nanga-ikan kivo  kagan
         house=many small far.too
         ‘many far too small houses’
         Intended: ‘far too many small houses’

    d.   nanga-ikan kagan   kivo
         house=many far.too small
         ‘far too many small houses’

=> (6d) should be clear functionally: more or less like in (7)
=> Except: is ‘far too’ an adverb here?
   => if words like ‘far too’ are also determiners, ‘many’ as a determiner
      can't be Spec (because Spec doesn't allow recursion).
   => adjectives like in (6ac) are normally modified by adverbs AFAIK
   => ‘far too overly many’ is kind of weird, so ‘far too’ in SpecDP there, 
      since no iteration? It's not a complement of ‘many’, anyway.

(7) +-                                   -+
    | PRED  'house'                       |

* How would one draw this as a tree-diagram, though, assuming that ‘far too
  many’ is in SpecNP, and not assuming traces?
* Maybe kagan ‘far too’ could be analyzed as a clitic in this case, since
  clitics tend to cluster?
* We have already seen that the order of kagan and kivo is not arbitrary, but 
  this actually is due to scope effects, cf. (6c).

(8) a. ? nanga-ikan, naratang, kagan   kivo
         house=many  say=3PL.A far.too small
         ‘far too, they say, many small houses’

    b. * nanga-ikan kagan   nay kivo
         house=many far.too and small
         Intended: ‘*many houses, far too and small’

    c.   nanga-ikan kivo  nay giro
         house=many small and cute
         ‘many small and cute houses’

* It is weird interrupting -ikan kagan with stuff.
  => That could also be because kagan is in SpecDP of the empty D node which
     would otherwise hold the quantifier if it weren't cliticized to N.
* Kagan and kivo do not coordinate in (8b). This is expected, since kagan
  isn't an adjective modifying nanga such as both kivo and giro in (8c).
* Alternatively, if kagan is not a clitic there (9a), maybe there's some kind
  of small clause (9b) or we have to assume that NPs is permitted to have a
  flat structure, at least under certain circumstances (9c) (mutatis mutandis 
  verbs?)
  => Can clitics modify other clitics?
