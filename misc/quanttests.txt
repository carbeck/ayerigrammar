Quantifier/Intensifier tests
============================

(1) a.   nanga kivo  ipan/ekeng
         house small extremely/too
         ‘extremely/too small house’

    b. * nanga kivo  nay ipan
         house small and extremely
         Intended: ‘*extremely and small house’

    c. * nanga kivo  ipan      nay ekeng
         house small extremely and too
         Intended: ‘*extremely and too small house’

(2) a.   nanga kivo  kay/diring
         house small three/several
         ‘three/several small houses’
        
    b. * nanga kivo  nay kay
         house small and three
         Intended: ‘*small and three houses’
        
    c. * nanga kivo  kay   nay diring
         house small three and several
         Intended: ‘*three and several small houses’

(3) a.   nanga kivo  (ipan)    nā
         house small extremely my
         ‘my (extremely) small house’

    b. * nanga kivo  nay nā
         house small and my
         Intended: ‘*my and small house’

    c. * nanga kivo  ipan      nay nā
         house small extremely and my
         Intended: ‘*my and extremely small house’

(4) a.   nanga kivo  malan diring
         house small dozen several
         ‘several dozen small houses’

         → malan ‘dozen’ is a numeral, though!

    b. * nanga kivo  diring  menikaneng
         house small several another
         Intended: ‘another several small houses’

    b.   nanga-ikan patu         kivo
         house=many surprisingly small
         ‘surprisingly many small houses’

    c.   nanga kivo  sam/diring  nā
         house small two/several my
         ‘several of my/my two small houses’

* Qs cannot be coordinated with adjectives, adverbs or possessive determiners
* Qs cannot be coordinated with each other
* Qs can be modified by adverbs, but not by other Qs
* Qs and possessives can cooccur

=> Qs are not ADJs, and neither are possessives
=> Qs are not adverbs, just like possessives aren't adjectives
=> Qs logically can't be compared (*severaler, *severalest; *veryer, veryest),
   unlike descriptive adverbs. OTOH, sentence adverbs also can't be compared
   (*basicallier, *basicalliest).
=> Qs must form a phrase with Q as a head (whether that is a free morpheme or
   expressed by a clitic) because they can be modified
=> Qs can't iterate and probably can't be recursive, so specifiers?
=> So possibly like (5), then?

       +-                                  -+

=> "Complements of functional categories are f-structure coheads" (Bresnan et
   al. 2016: 105), so N is a co-head of D, which means N and D share the same
   functional core, thus not 'my <(↑OBJ)>' but normal 'house <(↑POSS)>',
   because "my" as a functional head modifies "house" as a lexical head.

* On the other hand, what to do with clitic quantifiers which are modified by 
  adverbs (?) in place

(6) a.   nanga kivo  kagan
         house small far.too
         ‘far too small house’

    b. ? nanga kivo-ikan  kagan
         house small=very far.too
         ‘?far too very small house’

    c. ! nanga-ikan kivo  kagan
         house=many small far.too
         ‘many far too small houses’
         Intended: ‘far too many small houses’

    d.   nanga-ikan kagan   kivo
         house=many far.too small
         ‘far too many small houses’

=> (6d) should be clear functionally: more or less like in (7)
=> Except: is ‘far too’ an adverb here?
   => if words like ‘far too’ are also determiners, ‘many’ as a determiner
      can't be Spec (because Spec doesn't allow recursion).
   => adjectives like in (6ac) are normally modified by adverbs AFAIK
   => ‘far too overly many’ is kind of weird, so ‘far too’ in SpecDP there, 
      since no iteration? It's not a complement of ‘many’, anyway.

* How would one draw this as a tree-diagram, though, assuming that ‘far too
  many’ is in SpecNP, and not assuming traces?
* Maybe kagan ‘far too’ could be analyzed as a clitic in this case, since
  clitics tend to cluster?
* We have already seen that the order of kagan and kivo is not arbitrary, but 
  this actually is due to scope effects, cf. (6c).

(8) a. ? nanga-ikan, naratang, kagan   kivo
         house=many  say=3PL.A far.too small
         ‘far too, they say, many small houses’

    b. * nanga-ikan kagan   nay kivo
         house=many far.too and small
         Intended: ‘*many houses, far too and small’

    c.   nanga-ikan kivo  nay giro
         house=many small and cute
         ‘many small and cute houses’

* It is weird interrupting -ikan kagan with stuff.
  => That could also be because kagan is in SpecDP of the empty D node which
     would otherwise hold the quantifier if it weren't cliticized to N.
* Kagan and kivo do not coordinate in (8b). This is expected, since kagan
  isn't an adjective modifying nanga such as both kivo and giro in (8c).
* Alternatively, if kagan is not a clitic there (9a), maybe there's some kind
  of small clause (9b) or we have to assume that NPs are permitted to have a
  flat structure, at least under certain circumstances (9c) (mutatis mutandis 
  verbs?)
  => Can clitics modify other clitics?

* Or, the order of modifiers is simply variable and just like adjectives can
  take the position right after the noun and push complements further to the
  right, quantifiers can displace adjectives under certain circumstances:

              ↑   ·
              '···'

=> Would that maybe actually imply non-configurationality of NP?

* LFG conveniently also permits "non-projecting words" (Bresnan et al. 2016:
  116), where X ⟶ X, Ŷ. The example above could thus be analyzed as in (11),
  with kagan as a non-projecting word, D̄.
* Kagan would not be able to be modified then, though!
