* Qs cannot be coordinated with adjectives, adverbs or possessive determiners
* Qs cannot be coordinated with each other
* Qs can be modified by adverbs
* Qs and possessives can cooccur

=> Qs are not ADJs, just like possessives aren't
=> Qs are not adverbs, just like possessives aren't adjectives
=> Qs logically can't be compared (*severaler, *severalest; *twoer, *twoest; 
   *extremelier, *extremeliest)
=> Qs must form a phrase with Q as a head (whether that is a free morpheme or
   expressed by a clitic) because they can be modified
=> Qs can't iterate and are not recursive, so: specifiers
   => Qs and possessives can cooccur while specifiers don't allow recursiveness
   => Q not modifying possessor, but Q part of the NP complement of DP?


Possibly like this, then?

=> "Complements of functional categories are f-structure coheads" (Bresnan et
   al. 2016: 105), so N is a co-head of D, which means N and D share the same
   functional core, thus not 'my <(↑OBJ)>' but normal 'house <(↑POSS)>'?
