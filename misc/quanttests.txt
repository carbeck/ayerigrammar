* Qs cannot be coordinated with adjectives, adverbs or possessive determiners
* Qs cannot be coordinated with each other
* Qs can be modified by adverbs and other Qs
* Qs and possessives can cooccur

=> Qs are not ADJs, and neither are possessives
=> Qs are not adverbs, just like possessives aren't adjectives
=> Qs logically can't be compared (*severaler, *severalest; *twoer, *twoest; 
   *veryer, *veryest), unlike descriptive adverbs. OTOH, sentence adverbs also 
   can't be compared (*basicallier, *basicalliest).
=> Qs must form a phrase with Q as a head (whether that is a free morpheme or
   expressed by a clitic) because they can be modified
=> Qs can't iterate but apparently can be recursive, so not specifiers

So possibly like this, then?

=> "Complements of functional categories are f-structure coheads" (Bresnan et
   al. 2016: 105), so N is a co-head of D, which means N and D share the same
   functional core, thus not 'my <(↑OBJ)>' but normal 'house <(↑POSS)>',
   because "my" as a functional head modifies "house" as a lexical head.
