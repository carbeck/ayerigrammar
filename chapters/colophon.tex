Ayeri is a fictional language. As such, it is not related to any naturally
existing languages, living or dead. No real-world languages have been used
specifically as sources of vocabulary. Ayeri is also not derived from any
specific real-world language family by means of sound changes. Due to Ayeri's
sound and spelling aesthetic being inspired by Austronesian languages such as
Malay, Indonesian, or Tagalog, however, occasional overlaps with words existing
in these languages may happen, but only accidentally so.\\

guaranteed that any of these links will work indefinitely or show the exact
