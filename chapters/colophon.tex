Ayeri is a fictional language spoken by fictional people in a fictional setting, and as such is not related to any naturally existing languages. It is thus not to be confused with \emph{Azeri}, a Turkic language spoken in Azerbaijan and its surrounding countries. Ayeri’s vocabulary is entirely a priori, this means, no real-world languages have been used specifically as sources of vocabulary. Due to the language’s sound and spelling aesthetic being inspired by Austronesian languages, it is not surprising if overlaps with existing words in those languages happen accidentally.\\[.5\baselineskip]
