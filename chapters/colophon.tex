Ayeri is a fictional language spoken by fictional people in a fictional setting, 
and as such is not related to any naturally existing languages. It is thus not 
to be confused with \emph{Azeri}, a Turkic language spoken in Azerbaijan and its 
surrounding countries. Ayeri’s vocabulary is entirely \fw{a priori}, this 
means, no real-world languages have been used specifically as sources of 
vocabulary. Ayeri is also not derived from any specific real-world language 
family by means of sound changes. Due to the language’s sound and spelling 
aesthetic being inspired by Austronesian languages, however, occasional 
overlaps with words existing in those languages may happen, but only  
accidentally so.\\[.5\baselineskip]
