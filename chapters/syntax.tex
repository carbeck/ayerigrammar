\chapter{Phrase structures}

While the previous chapter dealt largely with the various parts of speech and 
their various distributive and inflectional properties, the present chapter 
will elaborate on how these words combine into syntactic phrases. Since Ayeri 
is a verb-initial language, it is probably most comfortably analyzed in terms 
of Lexical-Functional Grammar \citep{bresnan2016}, since \lfg{} does not 
require complicated derivations behind the surface structure of sentences. It 
will be assumed here that, even though Ayeri is basically VSO with predicate 
and predication not adjacent to each other, it is configurational in that there 
is a VP which c-commands a number of other constituents as complements in 
transitive sentences.

In principle, \lfg{} assumes that grammar operates on different structural 
levels: mainly, these are a(rgument) structure, c(onstituent) structure, and 
f(unctional) structure; other layers have been proposed by different 
researchers for different purposes \citep[862--865]{buttking2015}. 
\citet{bresnan2016} define three core design principles for \lfg{}:

\begin{description}
\item[Variability:] \textcquote[41]{bresnan2016}{The principle of variability 
states that \emph{external structures vary across languages}. The formal model 
of external structure in \lfg{} is the \emph{c-structure}, which stands for 
\enquote{constituent structure} or \enquote{categorial structure}}. 
C-structures are commonly represented by context-free phrase-structure rules; 
constituency trees are based on an extended version of \xbar{X} theory 
\citep[42]{bresnan2016}.

\item[Universality:] \textcquote[42]{bresnan2016}{The principle of universality 
states that \emph{internal structures are largely invariant across languages}. 
The formal model of internal structure in \lfg{} is the \emph{f-structure}, 
which stands for \enquote{functional structure}}. The f-structure is depicted 
as an argument-value matrix (\textsc{avm}) which maps the relations between 
`subject' (\Sbj{}), `object' (\Obj{}), `predicator' (\Pred{}), etc. as 
functional abstractions of NP, VP, V, etc. \citep[42]{bresnan2016}. Verbs are 
also encoded with their \fw{a-structure} indicated. That is, which arguments 
a verb takes is formally stated \citep[15]{bresnan2016}. The f-structure lists 
semantic features associated with words, such as case (\Case{}), person 
(\Pers{}), number (\Num{}), which are abstract features and as such need not 
have morphological realization \citep[43]{bresnan2016}.

\item[Monotonicity:] \textcquote[43]{bresnan2016}{Constituent structure form is 
simply not the same in all languages [...] In \lfg{} the correspondence mapping 
between internal and external structures does not preserve sameness of form. 
Instead, \emph{it is designed to preserve inclusion relations between the 
information expressed by the external structure and the content of the internal 
structure}}. Passivization, for instance, is assumed to be a lexically 
motivated alternation in predicate structure (\Sbj{} is blocked, so 
the nominative is assigned to \Obj{}, and the original \Sbj{} is expressed 
by an \Adjc{}), rather than an internal derivational process 
\citep[23\psqq]{bresnan2016}.

\end{description}

To illustrate the different parallel structures in operation, 
\citet[15]{bresnan2016} give the following schema concerning which part 
of the a- and c-structure respectively corresponds (`links', `maps') to which 
part of the f-structure:\footnote{\citet{bresnan2016} use \textsc{`subj'} for 
`subject'; for consistency with the above I will use `\Sbj{}' in the following.}

\ex\begin{tabular}[t]{l @{\quad} c}

\end{tikzpicture}

Regarding the grammatical functions distinguished, \lfg{} assumes the following 
functional hierarchy \citep[97]{bresnan2016}:

\pex\label{ex:functions}
\a Grammatical functions (GFs):\\
	$\overbrace{\Sbj{} > \Obj{} > \SObj{}}^{core} > 
	\overbrace{\OblqT{} > \XCompl{}, \Compl{} > \Adjc{}}^{noncore}$
\a Nonargument/discourse functions ($\overline{\mbox{AF}}$s/DFs):\\
	\Top{}, \Foc{}, \Adjc{}
\xe

The elements listed in (\ref{ex:functions}) will also appear in 
phrase-structure rules and c-structure trees together with arrows. These arrows 
symbolize inheritance of feature information from the current level (↓) of the 
tree to the next (↑), so for instance, `\pass{\Sbj}' means that the information 
subsumed by the current node (`down') is passed on as the subject function of 
the next higher node (`up') in the tree. More information on notational 
formalisms of \lfg{} can be found, for instance, in \citet{buttking2015}.

\section{Determiner- and noun phrases}

Noun phrases, and determiner phrases as their functional counterpart, fulfill 
the functions of subject (\Sbj{}), object (\Obj{}), secondary object (\SObj{}), 
as well as oblique location (\Oblq{loc}), and various adjuncts (\Adjc{}). 
NPs/DPs can also constitute topics (\Top{}). Which DP/NP receives which 
function is selected by the a-structure of the verb---this also has 
repercussions on case- and topic marking.

Generally, DPs and NPs can be described with the phrase structure formulas 
given in (\ref{ex:dpnpstruct}), which list the various parts that can occur in 
them; parentheses indicate the optionality of a term, that is, the respective 
element may occur but is not constitutive.

\pex\label{ex:dpnpstruct}
\a\label{ex:dpdef} DP → \anno*{D} (\anno*{NP})
\a\label{ex:npdef} NP → \anno*{N} (\anno*{AP*}) (\anno*{CP*})
\xe

The functional heads of DPs are formed by determiners. Ayeri does not possess 
articles as such, though it does have a variety of morphemes which occur 
as clitic prefixes on nouns which can be analyzed to fulfill this function. 
These clitics are the demonstrative prefixes \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, 
\xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}, and \xayr{d/}{da-}{such (a)}, as well as the 
inspecificity prefix \xayr{me/}{mə-}{some} (compare \autoref{subsec:nounpref}). 
These prefixes can only be used with nouns, but not with pronouns, since 
pronouns as well have the status of determiners. Pronouns, as pro-forms, are in 
complementary distribution with NPs containing a noun. In order to capture the 
fact that an NP is facultative with the demonstrative and inspecificity 
prefixes while it must not occur with pronouns, `NP' appears in parentheses in 
(\ref{ex:dpdef}), since it is not always present. We can furthermore define the 
following lexicosemantic rules for determiners:
