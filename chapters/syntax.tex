\chapter{Phrase structures}

While the previous chapter dealt largely with the various parts of speech and 
their various distributive and inflectional properties, the present chapter 
will elaborate on how these words combine into syntactic phrases. Since Ayeri 
is a verb-initial language, it is probably most comfortably analyzed in terms 
of Lexical-Functional Grammar \citep{bresnan2016}, since \Lfg{} does not 
require complicated derivations behind the surface structure of 
sentences.\footnote{Passivization, for instance, is assumed to be a lexically 
motivated alternation in predicate structure (\Sbj{} is blocked, so the 
nominative is assigned to \Obj{}, and the original \Sbj{} is expressed 
by an \Adjc{}), rather than an internal derivational process 
\citep[23\psqq]{bresnan2016}.} It will be assumed here that, even though Ayeri 
is basically VSO with predicate and predication not adjacent to each other, it 
is configurational in that there is a VP which c-commands a number of other 
constituents as complements in transitive sentences.

In principle, \Lfg{} assumes that grammar operates on different structural 
levels: mainly, these are a(rgument) structure, c(onstituent) structure, and 
f(unctional) structure; other layers have been proposed by different 
researchers for different purposes \citep[862--865]{buttking2015}. 
\citet{bresnan2016} define three core design principles for \Lfg{}:

\begin{description}
\item[Variability:] \textcquote[41]{bresnan2016}{The principle of variability 
states that \emph{external structures vary across languages}. The formal model 
of external structure in \Lfg{} is the \emph{c-structure}, which stands for 
\enquote{constituent structure} or \enquote{categorial structure}}. 
C-structures are commonly represented by context-free phrase-structure rules; 
constituency trees are based on an extended version of X-bar theory 
\citep[42]{bresnan2016}.\footnote{The basic recursive rules of X-bar theory 
are observed:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep, leftmargin={2\footnotemargin}]
\item \begin{enumerate}
	\item \xbar{X} → \xhead{X}, YP
	\item \xbar{X} → \xbar{X}, YP
\end{enumerate}\medskip
\item XP → YP, \xbar{X}
\end{enumerate}

The principle of economy of expression furthermore dictates that essentially, 
trees be pruned of empty terminal nodes and non-branching preterminal nodes, 
since these do not provide structurally or semantically relevant information 
\citep[119--128]{bresnan2016}.}

\item[Universality:] \textcquote[42]{bresnan2016}{The principle of universality 
states that \emph{internal structures are largely invariant across languages}. 
The formal model of internal structure in \Lfg{} is the \emph{f-structure}, 
which stands for \enquote{functional structure}}. The f-structure is depicted 
as an argument-value matrix (\Avm{}) which maps the relations between 
`subject' (\Sbj{}), `object' (\Obj{}), `predicator' (\Pred{}), etc. as 
functional abstractions of NP, VP, V, etc. \citep[42]{bresnan2016}. Verbs 
are also presented with their \fw{a-structure} spelled out. That is, which 
arguments a verb has relations to is formally stated \citep[15]{bresnan2016}. 
The f-structure collates semantic features associated with heads of grammatical 
functions (GFs), such as case (\Case{}), person (\Pers{}), number (\Num{}), 
which are abstract features and as such need not have morphological realization 
\citep[43]{bresnan2016}.

\item[Monotonicity:] \textcquote[43]{bresnan2016}{Constituent structure form is 
simply not the same in all languages [...] In \Lfg{} the correspondence mapping 
between internal and external structures does not preserve sameness of form. 
Instead, \emph{it is designed to preserve inclusion relations between the 
information expressed by the external structure and the content of the internal 
structure}}. Due to the principle of monorepresentation, 
information distributed over different morphemes which logically 
belongs to a single grammatical function is presented in the f-structure as 
unified.

To illustrate the different parallel structures in operation, 
\citet[15]{bresnan2016} give the schema in \autoref{fig:phimap} to demonstrate
which part of the a- and c-structure respectively corresponds (`links', `maps') 
to which part of the f-structure.\footnote{\citet{bresnan2016} use 
\textsc{`subj'} for `subject'; for consistency with the above I will use 
`\Sbj{}' in the following. I will also divergently use \Compl{} and 
\XCompl{} for \textsc{(x)comp}, since \textsc{comp} has already been used for 
`comparative' above.} Regarding the different functions distinguished, \Lfg{} 
assumes the following hierarchies \citep[97, 100]{bresnan2016}:

\pex\label{ex:functions}
\a\label{ex:gfs} Grammatical functions (GFs):\\
	$\overbrace{\Sbj{} > \Obj{} > \SObj{}}^{\text{core}} > 
	\overbrace{\OblqT{} > \XCompl{}, \Compl{} > \Adjc{}}^{\text{noncore}}$
\a\label{ex:nonafs} (Non)argument functions (AFs/$\overline{\mbox{AF}}$s):\\
	$\underbrace{\Top{}\: \Foc{}}_{\text{non-a-fns}}\; 
	\overbrace{\Sbj{}\: \Obj{}\: \SObj{}\: \OblqT{}\: \XCompl{}\: 
		\Compl{}}^{\text{a-fns}}\; 
	\underbrace{\Adjc{}}_{\text{non-a-fns}}$
\a\label{ex:dfs} Discourse functions (DFs):\\
	$\overbrace{\Top{}\: \Foc{}\: \Sbj{}}^{\text{d-fns}}\;  
	\underbrace{\Obj{}\: \SObj{}\: \OblqT{}\: \XCompl{}\: \Compl{}\: 
		\Adjc{}}_{\text{non-d-fns}}$
\xe

The elements listed in (\ref{ex:functions}) will also appear in 
phrase-structure rules and c-structure trees together with arrows. These arrows 
symbolize inheritance of feature information from the current level (↓) of the 
tree to the next (↑), so for instance, `\pass{\Sbj}' means that the information 
subsumed by the current node (`down') is passed on as the subject function of 
the next higher node (`up') in the tree. Concise information on notational 
formalisms of \Lfg{} can be found, for instance, in \citet{buttking2015}.

\section{Determiner- and noun phrases}
\label{sec:dps-nps}

Noun phrases (NPs), and determiner phrases (DPs) as their functional 
counterpart, fulfill the functions of subject (\Sbj{}), object (\Obj{}), 
secondary object (\SObj{}), as well as oblique location (\Oblq{loc}), and 
various adjuncts (\Adjc{}). DPs and NPs can also constitute topics (\Top{}). 
Which DP or NP receives which function is selected by the a-structure of the 
verb---this also has repercussions on case- and topic marking.

Generally, DPs and NPs can be described with the phrase-structure formulas 
given in (\ref{ex:dpnpstruct}), which list the various parts that can occur in 
them; parentheses indicate the optionality of a term, that is, the respective 
element may occur but is not constitutive.
% ; an asterisk stands for `zero or 
% more' occurrences of the respective element

\pex\label{ex:dpnpstruct}
\a\label{ex:dpdef} DP → \anno*{\xhead{D}} (\anno*{NP})
\a\label{ex:npdef} NP → \anno*{\xhead{N}} (\anno*[\pass{\Adjc}]{XP})
\xe

Since the constituent containing the various non-verbal elements in Ayeri is 
likely exocentric and constituents may move around within it in a restricted 
way, we have to assume that not constituent structure, but case marking 
identifies the grammatical functions of the various arguments of verbs. Thus, 
the following lexicocentric conditions operate on both DP and NP as exponents 
of case:

\ex\label{ex:dpnpcasemap}\labels
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{} l @{\quad} l @{$\implies$} l}
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Aarg	& \pass{\Sbj} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Parg	& \pass{\Obj} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Dat		& \pass{\SObj} \logor{}
						\pass{\Oblq{loc}} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Gen		& \pass{\Oblq{poss}} \logor{} 
						\pass{\Oblq{loc}} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Loc		& \pass{\Oblq{loc}} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Caus	& \pass{\Oblq{caus}} \\
\tl\quad & \downs{\Case} = \Ins		& \pass{\Oblq{ins}} \logor{} 
						\pass{\Adjc} \\
\end{tabular}
\xe

The rules in (\ref{ex:dpnpcasemap}) determine the typical mappings between case 
marking and grammatical functions, which are not always unambiguous. As 
explained above (compare \autoref{subsec:case}), the dative case does not only 
indicate that something is done to this referent or to their benefit, but it 
may also indicate motion towards this referent. Likewise, the genitive case 
does not only indicate possession, but also origin, and motion from this 
referent. Nominal adjuncts to nouns which specify what the noun consists also 
appear in the instrumental case, besides the instrumental being used to 
indicate the means or the circumstance by which an action comes about. 
Moreover, DPs or NPs may also lack case marking, which indicates that the 
respective phrase is a part of the topic of the verb, which is what 
(\ref{ex:topicrule}) describes:

\ex\label{ex:topicrule}
¬\,\downs{\Case} $\implies$ \elem{\Top}
\xe

Instead of case marking on the DP or NP, there is a marker in front of the verb 
which provides information on the case and, if \AgtT{} or \PatT{}, also about 
the animacy of the topicalized phrase. This means that grammatical information 
about the topic of a phrase is spread over two discontinuous locations. This 
issue does not pose a problem to an \Lfg{}-based analysis, however, since both 
locations unify their information content in the f-structure feature [\Top{}]. 
Since information located in multiple places is jointly feeding this feature, I 
am using the annotation `\elem{\Top}' for each location rather than simple 
`\pass{\Top}'. Note that only one NP among the arguments of a verb may be the 
topic of the phrase, and a topic can only be marked if the verb is finite and 
the number of arguments to the verb is greater than one.

\subsection{Determiner phrases}
\label{subsec:dps}

The functional heads of DPs are formed by determiners. The c-structure of a DP 
corresponding to the linear description in (\ref{ex:dpdef}) is depicted in 
(\ref{ex:dpcstruct}); annotations about feature inheritance for 
c-to-f-structure conversion have been added. If the DP has a dependent phrase 
providing lexical content, it is in the form of an NP, whose head forms a 
lexical co-head of \xhead{D}. Hence, the NP in the diagram below is annotated 
with \updown{} to signify that its features are inherited to DP 
wholesale, rather than forming an adunct of DP.

\ex\label{ex:dpcstruct}
\begin{forest}
[{\anno[\pass{df} \logor{} \pass{gf}]{DP}}
	[\anno{\xbar{D}}
		[\anno{\xhead{D}}]
		[$\left(\anno{NP}\right)$]
	]
]
\end{forest}
\xe

Ayeri does not possess articles as such, though it does have a variety of 
morphemes which occur as clitic prefixes on nouns which can be analyzed to 
fulfill this function. These clitics are the demonstrative prefixes 
\xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, \xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}, and \xayr{d/}{da-}{such (a)}, 
as well as the inspecificity prefix \xayr{me/}{mə-}{some} (compare 
\autoref{subsec:nounpref}). These prefixes can only be used with nouns, but not 
with personal pronouns (compare \autoref{subsec:perspro}), since personal 
pronouns as well have the status of determiners. Pronouns, as pro-forms, are in 
complementary distribution with NPs containing a noun. Due to affix-order 
considerations concerning the demonstrative prefixes, it also seems advisable 
to analyze the case markers of proper nouns as determiners. In order to capture 
the fact that an NP is facultative with the demonstrative and inspecificity 
prefixes while it must not occur with pronouns, `NP' appears in parentheses 
since a phrasal complement it is not always present. We can define the 
following morpholexic rules for determiners (\xhead{D}):

Demonstrative prefixes, the inspecificity prefix \rayr{me/}{mə-}, as well as 
proper-noun case markers cannot be without an NP complement, which is what 
`\req{}' is supposed to express in the feature specification: the demonstrative 
prefixes require that an element exist which encodes a third-person referent to 
are assumed to encode third person by default.\footnote{A simple `=' 
\emph{defines} a value; a subscript `c' indicates that the morpheme 
\emph{requires} that this value be present. Thus `\req{}' expresses a 
\fw{constraining} equation \citep[59--61]{bresnan2016}.} On the other hand, 
personal and demonstrative pronouns inherently define information on person 
(\Pers{}). Since there is a great number of both personal and demonstrative 
pronouns, only the various values they can assume are indicated, without 
ensuring that the combinations are actually possible (compare 
\autoref{subsec:perspro}). Personal pronouns, for instance, only distinguish 
\Inan{} as set against $\{\M{}, \F{}, \N{}\}$, which are subgroups of \An{}. 
Gender is also not distinguished in all persons, but only in the third.

\subsection{Noun phrases}

Regarding NPs proper, it is necessary to distinguish morphologically between 
those containing common nouns and those containing proper nouns (that is,  
names), as we have seen in the previous chapter (compare \autoref{sec:nouns}): 
common nouns indicate case by a suffix, while proper nouns receive case marking 
by a particle preceding the noun (see \autoref{subsec:dps} and below). Nouns 
can also be modified by adjectives, adverbs, adjunct nouns, or relative 
clauses, 
which are typically following the noun. The c-structure of NPs can be assumed 
to look like given in (\ref{ex:npcstruct}). Since modifiers of \xhead{N} 
(\xhead{N}'s sister node) can consist of different phrase types (AP, NP, DP, 
CP), they are indicated generalized as `XP' in the diagrams.

\ex\label{ex:npcstruct}\labels

In the following, I will again give a list of morpholexic specifications 
which give an overview of the different semantic and morphological features 
nouns provide (also compare \autoref{sec:nouns}):

\needspace{3\baselineskip}
\pex

Generally, both common and proper nouns provide information about person, 
number, gender, and animacy. As mentioned above, proper nouns require a 
particle to precede them which carries information on case. Case markers of 
nouns distinguish animacy for \Aarg{} and \Parg{} and are thus required to be 
consistent with the noun's animacy feature:\footnote{For clarity, I will only 
list the features relevant to the current discussion.}

Example (\ref{ex:animok}a) shows a well-formed construction: the noun, 
\xayr{gnF}{gan}{child}, is animate, hence the case particle also needs to be 
animate---the case particle must thus be \rayr{/As}{-as} to be coherent. In 
contrast to this, example (\ref{ex:animclash}b) is not well-formed in that the 
noun is animate but the case particle, \rayr{/lej}{-ley}, signals that 
it is inanimate: the \Anim{} values of the noun stem and its suffix 
clash and cannot be conclusively unified for \xhead{N} itself. The 
same principle of coherence is, of course, also true for proper nouns, which 
receive a case-marking particle. These are defined in (\ref{ex:dlexsem-propn}) 
as demanding that a noun with the correct animacy value be within their scope.

As previously mentioned, nouns may be modified by a number of adjuncts of
various phrase types: adjectives and adverbs (AP), genitive attributes (NP/DP), 
other nominal adjuncts (NP), and relative clauses (CP):

Of course, it is also possible to combine these nominal modifiers. In this 
case, a genitive NP always follows an adjective and an adjunct noun, while a 
relative clause always forms the last element in an NP. For one, the relative 
grammatical weight of a relative clause is very high, whether one counts 
\textcquote[102]{wasow1997}{words, nodes, or phrasal nodes} as indicators of 
grammatical weight. Relative clauses also trail whenever possible 
since placing one before a lighter element may make an utterance hard to 
construct coherently for the speaker, and hence also hard to understand for the 
listener. The following example (\ref{ex:nounmodord}) illustrates the unmarked 
order of modifiers.

\ex\label{ex:nounmodord}

As the c-structure tree in (\ref{ex:nounmodord}) shows, Ayeri prefers 
head--dependent word order with exceeding consistency as far as nominal 
modifiers are concerned; NPs/DPs are thus consistently right-branching. In the 
light of word order typology, we can formulate the following generalizations:

\pex
\a Order of noun and adjective: N Adj
\a Order of noun and genitive: N Gen
\a Order of noun and relative clause: N Rel

\subsection{Interactions between DP and NP}

With common nouns, a determiner which requires a complement (like the
demonstrative prefixes, for instance) simply cliticizes to the next \xhead{N}
it commands, which is illustrated in (\ref{ex:det+comn}). If a proper noun is
involved, however, there need to be two \xhead{D} slots, one for the case
marker, and another for the demonstrative prefix, which (\ref{ex:det+propn})
gives an example of: \xbar{D} is simply doubled to accommodate for another
\xhead{D}. In both cases, the determiner prefix is unstressed and combines 
phonetically with the NP modifier, as shown in (\ref{ex:det+comn}). If there is
no coalescence of vowels, as in (\ref{ex:det+propn}), the prefix remains
unstressed: \rayr{Ad/YnF}{ada-Yan} [a.da.ˈjan].

Furthermore, as mentioned before in \autoref{subsubsec:verbprefixes}, it is 
possible to abbreviate \xayr{dnY}{danya}{such one} + adjective as 
\rayr{d/}{da-} + adjective. This affixing of the indefinite demonstrative
essentially derives a complex anaphora.
% Since \xhead{D} can thus be
% modified not only by an NP but also by other types of phrases, the phrase 
% structure rule for DPs in (\ref{ex:dpdef}) contains a phrase with the general 
% label `XP'.
The trees charted in (\ref{ex:adjpron}) illustrate pronominalized
adjectives and possessive pronouns. The latter is possible because possessive 
NPs as well as adjectives are handled as modifiers of \xhead{N}, as we have 
seen above.

A problem which arises from this is that the demonstrative prefixes 
prototypically take NPs as modifiers, while adjectives and possessive pronouns 
form APs and DPs, respectively. It thus makes sense to assume 
that adjectives and possessive pronouns are nominalized prior to liason with a 
demonstrative prefixe, to receive the required third-person feature. For 
possessive pronouns, which may be of any person, this would mean that there is 
a mismatch between [\Index{} \Num{}] (semantic reference to an $n$th person) 
and the formal \Num{} feature.

The trees for \rayr{d/vn}{da-vana} in (\ref{ex:posspron}) illustrate one way to 
analyze the nominalization of the possessive pronoun, which otherwise serves as 
a modifier to a nominal head. This position, otherwise being associated 
with third person, is empty in this case, though by changing the category of 
the pronoun from DP to NP, the pronoun's outward encoding of second person is 
overwritten with third person as necessaitated by the demonstative prefix. The 
information about its second-person referent, however, is not lost, but 
preserved in the \Index{} feature of the nominalized pronoun. Moreover, as 
nominal forms, they can undergo case marking, so another mismatch between 
internal and external feature encoding may happen in that the possessive 
pronoun, itself being in genitive case, may syntactically be used in a 
different grammatical function, thus marked additionally for another case. It 
thus happens that \rayr{vn}{vana} in (\ref{ex:posspronpat}) is openly encoded 
for patient case (\rayr{/lej}{-ley} marks inanimate patient case) while 
lexically it is a genitive form---the patient form proper is 
\xayr{vaasF}{vās}{you}, but as such it does not indicate possession and also 
does not distinguish animacy, as this is distinguished in pronouns only in 
third person.

While it is possible to nominalize adjectives and possessive pronouns this way, 
the process as described above only works for single words---including 
quantifier suffixes, since these are clitic---but not for complex phrases.
