\chapter{Writing System}
\index{Tahano Hikamu|(}

In the previous chapter, example words were given in Ayeri's script, \rayr{thno 
hikmu}{Tahano Hikamu}, wherever possible. Thus, it seems advisable to include a 
description of Ayeri's native writing system here as well. Literally, 
\rayr{thno hikmu}{Tahano Hikamu} means `Round Script' (script round), which is 
an old formation based on the word \xayr{thnF/}{tahan-}{write} that  stuck. The 
current word for `script' is \xayr{thnnF}{tahanan}{writing}. Tahano Hikamu was 
originally named thus because of an earlier draft for a script that never made 
it very far beyond the drawing board and which was a lot more angular and boxy, 
see \autoref{fig:boxy}.\footnote{Unfortunately, there is no documentation 
surviving that I know of.}\index{Box script}

As we have seen in the previous chapter, Ayeri's prosody strongly emphasizes 
the syllable as a unit. Thus, it is not a surprise that Ayeri's native script,
Tahano Hikamu, is an alphasyllabary like the Brāhmī-derived alphabets of India 
and Southeast Asia \parencites{salomon1996}{court1996}.\index{Brāhmī scripts} 
This means that its 

\blockcquote[376]{salomon1996}{system is based on the unit of the graphic 
\enquote{syllalbe} […], which by definition always ends with a vowel (type V, 
CV, CCV, etc.). Syllables consisting of a vowel only (usually at the beginning 
of a word or sentence) are written with the \emph{full} or \emph{initial vowel 
signs} […]. But when, as is much more frequently the case, the syllable 
consists of a consonant followed by a vowel, the vowel is indicated by a 
diacritic sign attached to the basic sign for the consonant […].}

For Tahano Hikamu, the definition that a syllable consisting only of a vowel is 
written with an initial vowel sign is only true under certain circumstances, as 
we will see below. Moreover, Brāmī scripts are often characterized by 
conjuncts of clustered consonants which may become quite large and sometimes 
behave in an idiosyncratic way. Consonant conjuncts like Devanāgarī {\FS 
त्व}~\orth{tva} from {\FS त}~\orth{ta} + {\FS व}~\orth{va} or idiosyncratic 
conjuncts like {\FS क्ष} \orth{kṣa} for {\FS क} \orth{ka} + {\FS ष} \orth{ṣa} 
are not known in Tahano Hikamu, however. Tahano Hikamu also does not know 
subscript notation for consonant clusters and special diacritics marking coda 
consonants like in Javanese \citep[478--479]{kuipersmcdermott1996}. This does 
not mean, however, that final consonants are simply omitted in writing, since 
closed syllalbes are reasonably common enough in Ayeri to warrant indicating 
them. Thus, like in the Sumatran scripts, there is 
\textcquote[476]{kuipersmcdermott1996}{a special mark to eliminate the vowel of 
the previous syllable, thereby leaving a consonant in a syllable-final 
position.} That is, there is a diacritic that marks the absence of an inherent 
vowel.

Another difference from Brāhmī-family scripts is that there are unique 
graphemes for all basic vowels; vowel length and diphthongs in [ɪ] are indicated 
by dedicated diacritics. Like in Kharoṣṭhī---another historically important 
ancient script of India---initial vowels are not represented by unique 
graphemes but they are all written like post-consonantal diacritics with the 
grapheme for initial \orth{a} as a basis, \ayr{A} \citep[377]{salomon1996}. The 
\ayr{*a} on \ayr{ʔ} is understood as a diacritic as well, however, namely for 
/a/, which is why it is indicated in the table below as \ayr{ʔ} /Ø/, with no 
inherent sound value; its native name is 
\xayr{rnYn}{ranyan}{nothing}.\footnote{I will give the native names of graphemes 
here, but will refer to them by their English names for clarity in the 
running text.} Similar to a number of Brāhmī scripts, Tahano Hikamu puts 
diacritics not only below or above consonant bases, but also before them. This, 
however, is not limited to vowel graphemes as in Devanāgarī {\FS ि}~\orth{i} or 
Javanese \smash{\fontspec{Tuladha Jejeg}[Script=Javanese, 
Scale=MatchLowercase]ꦺ}~\orth{e, é/è} 
\citep[478]{kuipersmcdermott1996}.\footnote{\citet{kuipersmcdermott1996} do not 
say, but it looks likely to me that both are related, since they are both 
functionally the only prepended vowel diacritics and both represent a high front 
sound.}

\section{Consonants}
\index{consonants|(}

Tahano Hikamu is mainly based on consonant bases that are modified by 
diacritics. Since the vowel /a/ is so highly frequent in Ayeri, it is also the 
vowel that is \fw{inherent} to every consonant grapheme if not further modified 
by vowel diacritics. Consonant letters are simply referred to as \textit{pa, ta, 
ka, ...} \autoref{fig:consonants} displays all the main consonants. The 
customary collation is---similar to the IPA table---roughly grouping the letters 
according to their sound value by anteriority (front → back) and sonority (low → 
high). The script is monocameral, that is, there is no distinction between 
capital letters and minuscule letters as in the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, 
Georgian, and Armenian alphabet. It is also written in lines from left to right.

% \begin{center}\itshape
% 	pa, ta, ka;\\
% 	ba, da, ga;\\
% 	ma, na, nga;\\
% 	va, sa, ha;\\
% 	ra, la, ya;\\
% 	Ø.\\
% \end{center}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{tabu}
\label{fig:thcons}
\end{figure}

What is interesting about \ayr{N}~\orth{nga} is that even though before, /ŋ/ 
was treated strictly as a coda consonant in the previous chapter, it is in fact 
treated as an onset consonant in writing if a vowel is following:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\begingl
	\gla \ayr{p}	$+$	\ayr{NisF} //
	\glb /pa/	{}	/ŋis/ //
	\glft \rayr{pNisF}{pangis} /paŋ.is/ `money' //
\endgl\xe

Tahano Hikamu knows a few ligatures. First of all, when two \ayr{n} \orth{na} 
are in succession within a word, they will form a ligature \ayr{nn} \orth{nana}:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\begingl
	\gla \ayr{n}	$+$	\ayr{n}	→	\ayr{nn} //
	\glb /na/	{}	/na/	{}	/nana/ //
\endgl\xe

\noindent This is distinct from conjuncts like in Devanāgarī et al., though, 
since the unmodified sound value will still be /nana/, not */nna/, so the 
inherent vowel of each \ayr{n} \orth{na} is not deleted, and each \ayr{n} 
\orth{na} retains the ability to be modified by diacritics. Tahano Hikamu also 
has a few ligatures of the kind you would find in Brāhmī scripts, however:

\pex
	\a \ayr{q}~\orth{kwa} ← \ayr{k}~\orth{ka} + \ayr{v}~\orth{va},
	\a \ayr{T}~\orth{tsa} ← \ayr{t}~\orth{ta} + \ayr{s}~\orth{sa}, and 
	\a \ayr{x}~\orth{ksa} ← \ayr{k}~\orth{ka} + \ayr{s}~\orth{sa}.
\xe

\noindent These conjunct letters are, however, not normally employed by Ayeri. 
\autoref{fig:thconsadd} shows all additional consonants, added to write other 
languages. Individual languages may adapt the sound values slightly to fit their 
own purposes.

\section{Vowels}
\index{vowels|(}

As mentioned above, vowels are written as diacritics that are added to 
consonants. In principle, every consonant has two slots for vowels, a primary 
one atop it, and a secondary one below it. Vowels added to consonants in 
the primary slot delete their inherent /a/:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\begingl
	\gla \ayr{p}	→	\ayr{pe} //
	\glb /pa/	{}	/pe/ //
\endgl\xe

\begin{figure}[th]

	& \Tagati\huge AU
	\\

\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\label{fig:thvowstop}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:thvowstop} gives the primary vowel graphemes. Of the vowel 
graphemes given there, only \ayr{*ə}~\orth{ə} is not used in Ayeri. 
\ayr{*au}~\orth{au} is the only diphthong for which a dedicated grapheme 
exists, even though its occurrence is rather limited. The independent vowel 
graphemes are used at the beginning of words or inside words when there is no 
other way to spell the vowel, which is occasionally the case for secondary 
vowels. Secondary vowels are vowels that are not parts of diphthongs, but follow 
the vowel of a syllable directly. They are attached underneath a consonant base, 
for example:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\begingl
	\gla \ayr{y}	→	\ayr{ye}	→	\ayr{ye\_a} //
	\glb /ja/	{}	/je/		{}	/je.a/ //
\endgl\xe

In fact, the principle that every consonant base with its diacritics represents 
one syllable is slightly violated here, which is also the reason why secondary 
vowels very occasionally need to be spelled as independent vowels, for example 
when the secondary vowel is long, as in the word \xayr{ruAAnF}{ruān}{duty}:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\label{ex:rwaa}\begingl
	\gla \ayr{ru}	→	\ayr{ruAA}	\quad	(\,\ayr{ruu\_a}) //
	\glb /ru/	{}	/rwaː/ 		\quad	/ruːa/ //
\endgl\xe

Example (\ref{ex:rwaa}) uses a diacritic, \ayr{*aa}, to indicate length. If 
is put directly under \rayr{ru}{ru} (the \ayr{*\_a} diacritic moves down where 
it is not in the way), the syllable will incorrectly spell /ruːa/ instead of 
the intended /ruaː/. This is because diacritics modify consonants and primary 
vowels, but there is no way to modify a secondary vowel directly. 
\autoref{fig:thvowsbot} gives a list of secondary vowels corresponding to that 
of primary vowels above. The vowels as well are just referred to by their sound 
value; `primary' and `secondary', `superscript' and `subscript' or `upper' and 
`lower' may be chosen to disambiguate their positions; the native names may use 
\xayr{Iraj}{iray}{high} and \xayr{Ejr}{eyra}{low} to disambiguate, so \rayr{E 
Irj}{e iray} denotes the superscript \orth{e} diacritic while \rayr{E Ejr}{e 
eyra} denotes its subscript counterpart.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\caption{Secondary vowel graphemes of Tahano Hikamu}

\begin{tabu} to \linewidth{X[c] X[c] X[c] X[c] X[c] X[c] X[c]}

\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\label{fig:thvowsbot}
\end{figure}

As a further exception, those consonant bases with an ascender 
(\ayr{k}~\orth{ka}, \ayr{d}~\orth{da}, \ayr{C}~/ça/) move the primary vowel to 
the secondary slot below the consonant by default while indicating the vacancy 
of the primary slot at the top with a dot. This is done to avoid crossing the 
ascender of the consonant with a vowel diacritic:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\begingl
	\gla \ayr{k}	→	\ayr{k\_i}	→	\ayr{ki} //
	\glb /ka/	{}	/ka.i/		{}	/ki/ //
\endgl\xe

If the primary vowel slot were not silenced by the \ayr{*\_F} diacritic, it 
could reasonably be assumed that the consonant is not losing its inherent /a/ 
and the vowel below the consonant indicates a secondary vowel, spelling /CaV/. 
If, however, a secondary vowel is \emph{actually} added, primary and secondary 
vowels will be assigned the regular primary and secondary slots, respectively, 
again. This condition also holds true for subscript diacritics.

\pex[lingstyle=thex]
\a\begingl
	\gla \ayr{ki}	→	\ayr{ki\_e} //
	\glb /ki/	{}	/ki.e/ //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \ayr{ki}	→	\ayr{kii} //
	\glb /ki/	{}	/kiː/ //
\endgl

\xe

The order of secondary vowels and subscript diacritics is iconic insofar as 
it follows the order of sounds in the syllable. Thus, secondary vowels appear 
below the consonant-doubling diacritic, \ayr{*F*}, while they appear above the 
syllable-final homorganic nasal diacritic, \ayr{*\_M}:

\pex[lingstyle=thex]\label{ex:subscrord}
\a\begingl
	\gla \ayr{pFp}	→	\ayr{pFpe\_a} //
	\glb /ppa/	→	/ppea/ //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \ayr{peM}	→	\ayr{pe\_aM} //
	\glb /peN/	→	/peaN/ //
\endgl
\xe

\section{Diacritics}
\index{diacritics|(}

We have already encountered a few diacritics, though Tahano Hikamu comes with 
a lot more, some of which undergo non-trivial positioning and repositioning 
rules. As vowels are primarily expressed as superscripts, diacritics are 
primarily realized as subscripts, so in the following I will first describe 
subscript diacritics; then prepended diacritics, which Ayeri also has a number 
of, both as graphemes in their own right and as allographs of other subscript 
diacritics; and then, lastly, superscript diacritics.

\subsection{Subscript Diacritics}

	\\

\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\label{fig:thdiabot}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\autoref{fig:thdiabot} shows the bottom-attaching diacritics. The `large 
diacritics' cause the secondary slot of consonants to move down below the 
diacritic. `Small diacritics' can attach in this place as well as secondary 
vowels, as does the homorganic nasal diacritic \ayr{*M} in this 
diacritic-fraught example:

\ex[lingstyle=thex]\label{ex:caampuluy}\begingl
	\gla \ayr{tYaan} $+$ \ayr{puluj} → \ayr{tYaaMpuluj} //
	\glb {/ˈtʃaːn/} {} {/puˈlʊɪ/} {} {/ˌtʃaːmpuˈlʊɪ/} //
% 	\glc \xayr{tYaanF}{cān}{love} {} \xayr{puluj}{puluy}{opposite} {}
% 		\xayr{tYaaMpuluj}{cāmpuluy}{heterosexual} //
	\glft \xayr{tYaaMpuluj}{cāmpuluy}{heterosexual} //
\endgl\xe

It also needs to be noted that diacritics like \ayr{*Y} are applied to words as 
a whole, not stopping at morpheme and syllable borders, so even though 
\tayr{toryeng}{she sleeps} may be a composed form (\xayr{torF/}{tor-}{sleep} + 
\rayr{/yeNF}{-yeng} (=\TsgF{}.\Aarg{})) and syllabifies as /tor.ˈjeŋ/, the 
spelling is not *\,\ayr{torF\zwsp{}yeNF} as one might expect, but \ayr{torYeNF}.

Even though the primary position for small diacritics is underneath consonants, 
the diacritic deleting the inherent vowel, \ayr{*F}, very commonly also 
appears after a consonant letter at the end of words:

\ex[everygla=\Tagati\Large,everyglb=\itshape]\begingl
	\gla y nimFreN\thafterdot{} pNn\thafterdot{} 
		nraanFyen. //
	\glb Ya nimreng pangan narānyena. //
	\glc Ya nim-reng pangan-Ø narān-ye-na //
	\glc \LocT{} appear=\TsgI{}.\Aarg{} end-\Top{} word-\Pl{}-\Gen{} //
	\glft `It appears at the end of words.' //
\endgl\xe

This strategy is advantageous since Tahano Hikamu leaves very little to no 
space between individual words: \ayr{y nimFreN\thafterdot{} pNn\thafterdot{} 
nraanFyen.} With the dot after the consonant, word boundaries are much more 
visible.

\subsection{Prepended Diacritics}

Example (\ref{ex:caampuluy}) leads us directly to the next class of 
diacritics---ones that are prepended to the consonant letter, either because 
they are simply placed there or because of allography. Let us first list those 
diacritics that appear in front of consonants obligatorily 
(\autoref{fig:thdiapreobl}).

As \autoref{fig:thdiapreobl} shows, the only obligatorily prepended diacritic 
that Ayeri uses is the one that marks diphthongs, \ayr{*j}.\index{diphthongs} 
However, there are also a number of diacritics that are also obligatorily 
prepended to consonants, but do so as context-sensitive allographs 
(\autoref{fig:thdiapreallo}). The selection of the variant diacritics is not 
random or up to the aesthetic eye of the writer (even though the device itself 
is certainly a matter of aesthetics), but it is governed by rules. The 
prepended forms listed in \autoref{fig:thdiapreallo} are thus triggered 

\begin{enumerate}
\item when there is no stem or bowl for the regular subscript diacritic to 
	attach to, which is the case for \ayr{n}~\orth{na}, \ayr{N}~\orth{nga}, 
	\ayr{v}~\orth{va}, and \ayr{w}~\orth{wa}:

\item when a large subscript diacritic would be added after another large 
	subscript diacritic---this position can only be filled in once, so 
	further large subscripts are prepended:
	
	\ex[lingstyle=thex,everygla=\normalsize,everyglb=\upshape\Large,
		aboveglcskip=0.5em,numoffset=\leftmargin]\label{ex:stacking}
	\begingl
		\gla {} {$+$ \ayr{*H}} {} {$+$ \ayr{*Y}} {} {$+$ \ayr{*i}} {}
			{$+$ \ayr{*aa}} {} //
		\glb \ayr{t} → \ayr{tH} → \ayr{tHY} → \ayr{tHYi} → 
			\ayr{tHYii} //
		\glc /ta/ {} /tʰa/ {} /tʰja/ {} /tʰji/ {} /tʰjiː/ //
	\endgl\xe
	
	The order of diacritics follows the logic of the respective 
	language's phoneme inventory, so if there are, for example, 
	retroflex consonants and both dental and retroflex consonants can be 
	aspirated, retroflexion would be marked first, then aspiration. If 
	there is a palatalization contrast on top of this, the diacritic would 
	be added after aspiration.
	
	When adding large diacritics to stemless consonants, they are prepended 
	from the beginning, as we saw in (\ref{ex:stemless}), and just like in 
	(\ref{ex:stacking}), this principle continues:
	
	\ex[lingstyle=thex,everygla=\normalsize,everyglb=\upshape\Large,
		aboveglcskip=0.5em,numoffset=\leftmargin]
	\begingl
		\gla {} {$+$ \ayr{*Y}} {} {$+$ \ayr{*aa}} {} {$+$ \ayr{*j}} 
			{} //
		\glb \ayr{n} → \ayr{nY} → \ayr{nYaa} → \ayr{nYaaj} //
		\glc /na/ {} /nja/ {} /njaː/ {} /njaːɪ/ //
	\endgl\xe

\item with consonants directly following \ayr{n}~\orth{na}, to avoid a clash 
	with its swash:
	
	\ex[lingstyle=thex,numoffset=\leftmargin]
	\begingl
		\gla \ayr{n} $+$ \ayr{paa} → \ayr{npaa} \quad
			(*\,\ayr{n\zwsp{}paa}) //
		\glb /na/ {} /paː/ {} /napaː/ {} {} //
	\endgl\xe
	
	An exception to this exception occurs, however, when the consonant is 
	not directly following. In this case, no reordering happens, only 
	\ayr{n}~\orth{na} \emph{may} reduce its descender in size to 
	accommodate the following prepended diacritic:\footnote{The font I am 
	using here is designed so that the reduced combination looks nicer, but 
	if unreduced, \ayr{n}~\orth{na}'s swash is not so long as to cross the 
	descender of \ayr{*j} either.}
	
	\pex[lingstyle=thex,numoffset=\leftmargin]
	\begingl
		\gla \ayr{n} $+$ \ayr{pj} → \ayr{npj} \quad
			(\ques{}\ayr{n\zwsp{}pj}) //
		\glb /na/ {} /paɪ/ {} /napaɪ/ {} {} //
	\endgl\xe
	
\item in other cases where a clash of subscript diacritics needs to be avoided:

	\ex[lingstyle=thex,numoffset=\leftmargin]
	\begingl
		\gla \ayr{di} $+$ \ayr{paa} → \ayr{diːp} \quad 
			(*\,\ayr{dipaa}) //
		\glb /di/ {} /paː/ {} /dipaː/ {} {} //
	\endgl\xe
	
	Alternatively, the following solution is also permissible:
	
	\ex[lingstyle=thex,numoffset=\leftmargin]%
	\begingl
		\gla \ayr{di} $+$ \ayr{paa} → 
		% Due to negligence when coding the Tahano Hikamu font, I did 
		% not build in a way to manually put a diacritic on top of ⟨ka⟩ 
		% and ⟨da⟩, thus I need to put it on the letter with LaTeX 
		% commands, which is very clumsy. Younger self: shame on you!
		\ayr{d\hspace{-.3em}\raisebox{1.5ex}{\zwsp i}\hspace{.3em}%
			paa} //
		\glb /di/ {} /paː/ {} /dipaː/ //
	\endgl\xe
	
	When two long syllables follow each other, as in 
	\tayr{bāmā}{mom-and-dad}, one of the length diacritics should 
	definitely be pulled to the front:
	
	\ex[lingstyle=thex,everyglb=\upshape\Large,aboveglcskip=0.5em,
	numoffset=\leftmargin]
	\begingl
		\gla {} \ayr{baa} $+$ \ayr{maa} → \ayr{baaːm} \quad 
			(\ques{}\ayr{baamaa}) //
		\glb {\normalsize or:\quad} \ayr{baa} $+$ \ayr{maa} → 
			\ayr{ːbmaa} //
		\glc {} /baː/ {} /maː/ {} /baːmaː/ //
	\endgl
	
	\xe

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Superscript Diacritics}

Ayeri's standard position for diacritics is below consonants, but sometimes it 
is nicer to put them on top, especially for the letter \ayr{n}~\orth{na} due to 
its swash, as well as for \ayr{v}~\orth{va} since the space below its flag is 
empty otherwise, thus not providing much of a visual connection. The only 
diacritic that is normally attaching at the top of consonants is that for the 
glottal stop---we have already encountered its subscript allograph earlier. 
Since Ayeri's phoneme inventory does not possess a phonemic glottal stop or 
glottalization, this diacritic is not used in Ayeri. The list of superscript 
diacritics is given in \autoref{fig:thdiatop}.

While the subscript position is preferred for diacritics, it may be necessary 
to attach both a superscript diacritic and a vowel sign above a consonant. In 
this case, the consonant-modifying diacritic is placed first and the vowel 
diacritic on top of it---this is exactly equivalent to the rule exemplified for 
subscript diacritics in (\ref{ex:subscrord}).

\section{Numerals}
\index{numerals!digits|(}

Ayeri uses a number system based on units of 12, that is, it is duodecimal, 
which is a typological rarity.\footnote{And one possibly overrepresented by 
fictional languages due to its rarity in natural languages.} There is a digit 
for zero, so the system is positional, like the Hindu–Arabic digits used by the 
Latin alphabet. The numbers from 1 to 12 are shown in \autoref{fig:thnum}.

\section{Punctuation and Abbreviations}
\index{punctuation|(}

Tahano Hikamu's system of manipulating the sound of syllables is very 
sophisticated, so it comes as no surprise that it is also host of a large 
number of punctuation symbols. \autoref{fig:thpunctcom} lists the ones commonly 
encountered, \autoref{fig:thpunctuncom} the ones not so commonly encountered, 
and ones having fallen out of use.

\ayr{.}~\orth{.} does not look very much like a dot or a point, but it is 
derived from a sign that looks like two circles stacked on top of each other, 
similar to \ayr{/}~\orth{-} (see \autoref{fig:th2005}). There is no mark for a 
comma as such, so \ayr{/}~\orth{-} or \ayr{–}~\orth{--} cannot be 
used in this way. Instead of a comma, a wide word space is used to separate 
syntactic units. A long dash \ayr{—}~\orth{---} is also sometimes found at the 
end of paragraphs or texts to mark their end. The strong 
exclamation mark \ayr{‼} may also appear in its exclamatory function at the end 
of a larger section, but does not necessarily indicate special emphasis in this 
case.

\section{Styles}

Over the course of the years since Tahano Hikamu's inception, I have liked to 
experiment with different styles of writing, that is, I tried applying a 
number of different writing styles to the script to change its look and feel 
while still staying true to the overall character shapes and the system behind 
the script. The example text I will be using to illustrate the different styles 
in the following is the first article of the United Nations 
\tit{\citetitle{udhr}}:

\blockcquote[Article 1]{udhr}{\textit{Sa vesayon keynam-ikan tiganeri nay
kaytanyeri sino nay kamo.\\
Ri toraytos tenuban nay iprang, nay ang mya rankyon sitanyās ku-netu.}

[All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\\
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards each other 
in a spirit of brotherhood.]}

\index{Tahano Hikamu!regular/book style}
The examples above are all written in a style I call `book style' since it 
comes closest to printing, or also what might be conceivable as being written 
with quills or nibs on parchment or paper---of course, pen and paper is what I 
used to make up the letters in the first place, without second thought. The 
`book style' letters are what I consider the canonical form. 
\autoref{fig:thbook} shows the above article in this letter style.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
\caption{Tahano Hikamu, `book style'}
{\Tagati\Large s vesyonF kejnmF/IknF tigneri nj kjtnFyeri sino nj kmo.\\
ri torjtosF tenubnF nj IpFrNF, nj ANF mY rMkYonF sitnFyaasF 
ku/netu.}
\label{fig:thbook}
\end{figure}

\index{Tahano Hikamu!angular style (\ayr{hinY})}
As described above, I have long found the look of the Javanese script rather 
interesting and thus I tried applying the general aesthetics to Tahano Hikamu 
some time. As mentioned above as well, there are no subscript letters and in 
Ayeri, and the number of large swirling diacritics is also rather low, so this 
is definitely a difference. The `angular' style (\xayr{hinY}{hinya}{angular}) is 
displayed by \autoref{fig:thangular}.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
\caption{Tahano Hikamu, `angular style'}
{\Tagati\itshape\Large s vesyonF kejnmF/IknF tigneri nj kjtnFyeri sino nj kmo.\\
ri torjtosF tenubnF nj IpFrNF, nj ANF mY rMkYonF sitnFyaasF 
ku/netu.}
\label{fig:thangular}
\end{figure}

\index{Tahano Hikamu!hand style (\ayr{spj})}
Neatly reproducing the shapes of either the `book style' or the `angular style' 
by hand takes a lot of work goes rather slowly, so I was wondering at some 
point what daily handwriting could look like. Of course, this is once again 
based on pen and paper, though \citet[377]{salomon1996} mentions that 
inscriptions of Brāhmī have been found in the shape of copper plates and plates 
made of other metals, besides stone. Metal plates can be inscribed with 
metal styluses and should allow similar shapes and dexterity as modern 
pens.\footnote{\citet[378]{salomon1996} writes further that \textquote{very few 
such documents survive in South Asia, though we do have early non-epigraphic 
specimens on wood, leather, palm leaf, and birch bark from Inner Asia.}} 
\autoref{fig:thhand} shows what Tahano Hikamu might look like quickly jotted 
down by hand.

\begin{figure}[ht]\centering
\caption{Tahano Hikamu, `hand style'}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/tahanohand-300dpi-bw.png}
\label{fig:thhand}
\end{figure}

\index{Tahano Hikamu!blackletter style}
Most recently, I also wondered what Tahano Hikamu could look like if a style 
inspired by European medieval blackletter writing with its characteristic 
broken lines were applied to it. This, of course, is very much a difference to 
Ayeri's look and feel both as a spoken and written language, which made the 
experiment all the more interesting to me. \autoref{fig:thblack} shows what the 
passage may have looked like interpreted by European scribes in the high to 
late middle ages, when Gothic book hands ruled.
