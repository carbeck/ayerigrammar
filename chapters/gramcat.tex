\chapter{Grammatical categories}

While the previous chapter was about general mechanisms of marking in Ayeri, 
this chapter will dive into the various parts of speech in order to define 
their morphology with a closer look. I will begin with nouns as the main 
carriers of meaning, then deal with other parts of speech that regularly 
feature in the noun phrase---pronouns, adjectives, and adpositions. Following 
this, there will be a discussion of verbs and adverbs before moving on to 
numerals and conjunctions.

\section{Nouns}
\index{nouns|(}

Nouns in Ayeri have \emph{gender} and \emph{number} as their inherent 
grammatical properties. Besides common nouns, there are, of course, also proper 
nouns (i.e. names) and deverbal nouns. Nouns, as the heads of NPs, are also 
assigned \emph{case} by the VP, which is a third grammatical property they 
display. For an illustration of the declension paradigms, compare Figures 
\ref{fig:anideclcons}–\ref{fig:inandeclvow}.

\subsection{Gender}
\index{gender|(}

\begin{figure}[hb]
\caption{Grammatical genders in Ayeri}\centering
\begin{forest}

\end{forest}
\label{fig:gramgend}
\end{figure}

Grammatical gender in Ayeri consists of two tiers which are subdivided into 
four classes based on a mixture of semantic and epistemic properties, see 
\autoref{fig:gramgend}. The animate gender refers, broadly speaking, to entities 
that are considered alive or are closely associated with living entities, such 
as events, concepts, or activities executed by living things. The `masculine' 
and `feminine' subcategories are applied to humans, animals whose sex is known 
(for example on behalf of breeding them or keeping them as pets), and 
gods---basically anything that shows sexual dimorphism or is assumed to be an 
exponent of it as well as nouns referring to such entities in a functional way, 
for instance, \xayr{bdnF}{badan}{father} and \xayr{maav}{māva}{mother}. The 
remainder falls into the `neuter' category---plants, for instance, body parts, 
or animals whose sex is unknown. The `inanimate' category typically contains 
tools or materials. Furthermore, animals and plants change their category to 
inanimate as well if they serve as food. There are exceptions to either group, 
where elements appear in them for no obviously discernable reason. In order to 
illustrate, here are a few examples for each category:

\pex
	\a Animate masculine:\\
		\xayr{\larger bdnF}{badan}{father}, 
		\xayr{\larger netu}{netu}{brother}, 
		\xayr{\larger AguynF}{aguyan}{rooster}, 
		\rayr{\larger AgYaanF}{Ajān}, 
		\rayr{\larger ltunF}{Latun};
		% FIXME: bull? stallion? dog?
	
	\a Animate feminine:\\
		\xayr{\larger maav}{māva}{mother}, 
		\xayr{\larger kin}{kina}{sister}, 
		\xayr{\larger Aguvj}{aguvay}{hen}, 
		\rayr{\larger mh}{Maha}, 
		\rayr{\larger tFraanj}{Trānay};
		% FIXME: cow? mare? bitch?
	
	\a Animate neuter:\\
		\xayr{\larger AdNF}{adang}{palm tree},
		\xayr{\larger bino}{bino}{color},
		\xayr{\larger IkmF}{ikam}{deer},
		\xayr{\larger kdaanF}{kadān}{harvest},
		\xayr{\larger tYaanF}{cān}{love},
		\xayr{\larger nN}{nanga}{house}, 
		\xayr{\larger tMpu}{tampu}{luck},
		\xayr{\larger yil}{yila}{foot};
	
	\a Inanimate:\\
		\xayr{\larger AhlF}{ahal}{sand},
		\xayr{\larger hem}{hema}{egg},
		\xayr{\larger khnF}{kahan}{spear},
		\xayr{\larger meluNF}{melung}{yogurt},
		\xayr{\larger nusaanF}{nusān}{damage},
		\xayr{\larger pyutaanF}{payutān}{mathematics}.
\xe

There are also a number of doublets like French \fw{le livre} `the book' and 
\fw{la livre} `the pound', for instance, \ayr{bnnF} \fw{banan} (an.) `kindness, 
charity' or \ayr{bino} \fw{bino} (an.) `color' on the one hand, and 
\ayr{bnnF} \fw{banan} (inan.) `quality' or \ayr{bino} \emph{bino} (inan.) 
`paint' on the other. Gender is reified by case marking as well as verb 
agreement; it is not possible to read the gender of a noun from its phonological 
makeup. The following example illustrates differences in case marking and 
agreement (inherent information on grammatical features underneath the NPs):

\pex
\a\label{ex:gender1}\begingl
	\gla Ang konja badan hemaley. //
	\glb Ang kond-ya badan-Ø hema-ley //
	\glc {} {} {\tiny [\TsgM{}.\An{}}] {\tiny [\TsgI{}]} //
	\glc \AgtT{}.\An{} eat-\TsgM{}.\An{} father-\Top{} egg-\PargI{} //
	\glft `Father eats an egg.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:gender2}\begingl
	\gla Sa tombara kahanreng burang. //
	\glb Sa tomb-ara kahan-reng burang-Ø //
	\glc {} {} {\tiny [\TsgI{}]} {\tiny [\TsgN{}.\An{}]} //
	\glc \PatT{}.\An{} kill-\TsgI{} spear-\AargI{} animal-\Top{} //
	\glft `The animal, the spear kills it.' //
\endgl

\xe

In example (\ref{ex:gender1}), the noun in the agent NP, 
\xayr{bdnF}{badan}{father}, bears the features \textsc{[+\,animate, 
+\,masculine]}, which triggers the animate agent topic agreement marker 
\rayr{ANF}{ang} on the verb, since the agent NP is also topicalized. The verb 
also agrees in person and number with the agent NP by way of the person marker 
\rayr{/y}{-ya} for third person singular masculine. The object of the sentence, 
\xayr{hem}{hema}{egg}, on the other hand bears the feature 
\textsc{[–\,animate]}, so it receives the inanimate patient case marker 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley} rather than its animate counterpart \rayr{/AsF}{-as}.

In (\ref{ex:gender2}), on the other hand, we see an inanimate agent, 
\xayr{khnF}{kahan}{spear}, so the verb receives the marker \rayr{/Ar}{-ara} for 
third person singular inanimate rather than its animate neuter counterpart 
\rayr{/yo}{-yo}. That the agent of the clause is inanimate is also shown by the 
(non-topicalized) NP's case marking: \rayr{khnF}{kahan} carries the marker 
\rayr{/reNF}{-reng}, which marks it as an inanimate agent. The object of the 
sentence, \xayr{burNF}{burang}{animal}, is also the topic, hence topic agreement 
on the verb uses the marker \rayr{s}{sa} according to the NP being animate, 
rather than its inanimate counterpart \rayr{le}{le}.

\index{gender|)}

\subsection{Number}
\index{number|(}

Ayeri only distinguishes singular and plural in nouns, which receive plural 
marking; verbs, then, agree with agent NPs in number in the canonical case. 
Ordinarily, nouns in Ayeri are countable, however, there is also a group of 
uncountable nouns as well as a (small) group of nouns which are always plural. 
As above, I will list a few words from each group in the following example:

\pex
	\a Countable nouns:\label{ex:plurals}\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		\makebox[7em][l]{\xayr{\larger AgYmF}{ajam}{toy}}
			\xayr{\larger AgYmFye}{ajamye}{toys}, %
				\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		\makebox[7em][l]{\xayr{\larger devo}{devo}{head}}
			\xayr{\larger devoye}{devoye}{heads}, %
				\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		\makebox[7em][l]{\xayr{\larger InunF}{inun}{fish}}
			\xayr{\larger InunFye}{inunye}{fish} (pl.),%
				\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		\makebox[7em][l]{\xayr{\larger netu}{netu}{brother}}
			\xayr{\larger netuye}{netuye}{brothers};
	
	\a Uncountable nouns:\\
		\xayr{\larger AhlF}{ahal}{sand}, 
		\xayr{\larger bkj}{bakay}{stuff}, 
		\xayr{\larger ghaanF}{gahān}{hope}, 
		\xayr{\larger miNnF}{mingan}{ability};
	
	\a Plurale tantum nouns:\\
		\xayr{\larger burNF}{burang}{lifestock, 
			cattle},\footnotemark~
		\xayr{\larger gneNnF}{ganengan}{siblings}, 
		\xayr{\larger kejnmF}{keynam}{people}, 
		\xayr{\larger tNF}{tang}{ears}.
\xe

\footnotetext{Specifically in this meaning; \rayr{burNF}{burang} can also simply 
mean `animal', in which case there is a plural form 
\xayr{burNFye}{burangye}{animals}.}

Most concrete things that exist as clearly separate entities are countable, 
also, for instance, animals and lifestock---fish, deer, sheep etc. are thus 
countable, unlike in English; pants, pliers, scissors, glasses, etc. are by 
default singular as well. Uncountable, on the other hand, are materials in 
general or abstract concepts. There is also a number of nouns which is plural 
by default, most notably entities which often occur in groups, but there is as 
well the odd word for which there seems to be no reason to be included in this 
group, for instance, \xayr{\larger bino}{bino}{paint}, and \xayr{\larger 
giMbj}{gimbay}{sorrows}. A few body parts are also plurale tantum nouns, 
especially those which occur in pairs (\xayr{niv}{niva}{eye} is a notable 
exception).

\index{morphophonology!of the plural marker}\index{plural}
As demonstrated in (\ref{ex:plurals}), the noun plural marker is 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye}, which in native orthography also occurs in the variant 
\ayr{*Ye} or \ayr{ʲ*e}. As described above (\autoref{pluralmorph}, 
p.~\pageref{pluralmorph}), the plural marker may also be reduced to [dʒ] 
\orth{-j} before case suffixes that begin with /j/ or with a vowel other than 
/e/, like \rayr{/ANF}{-ang} (\Aarg{}) or \rayr{/ymF}{-yam} (\Dat{}):

\pex
	\a \rayr{\larger dirnFANF}{diranang} (uncle-\Aarg{})
		+ \rayr{\larger /ye}{-ye} (\Pl{}) %\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		→ \rayr{\larger dirnFye\_aNF}{diranjang} (uncle-\Pl{}-\Aarg{}),
	\a \rayr{\larger dirnen}{diranena} (uncle-\Gen{})
		+ \rayr{\larger /ye}{-ye} (\Pl{}) %\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		→ \rayr{\larger dirnFyen}{diranyena} (uncle-\Pl{}-\Gen{}),
	\a \rayr{\larger dirnFymF}{diranyam} (uncle-\Dat{})
		+ \rayr{\larger /ye}{-ye} (\Pl{}) %\\[0.5\baselineskip]
		→ \rayr{\larger dirnFyeymF}{diranjyam} (uncle-\Pl{}-\Dat{}).
\xe

For pluralia tantum, to express a singular entity, it is always possible to 
use a genitive phrase like \xayr{—/En menF}{…-ena men}{one of …} (…-\Gen{} 
one), for instance:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Nupayon tangang nā. //
	\glb Nupa-yon tang-ang nā //
	\glc hurt-\TplN{} ears-\Aarg{} \Fsg{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `My ears hurt.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Na nupareng tang nā men. //
	\glb Na nupa-reng tang-Ø nā men //
	\glc \GenT{} hurt-\TsgI{}.\Aarg{} ears-\Top{} \Fsg{}.\Gen{} one //
	\glft `One of my ears, it hurts.' //
\endgl
\xe

Number in nouns can also be manipulated by quantifiers which attach to declined 
nouns as suffixes. In this case, when plurality is indicated by the 
quantifier, the noun is not additionally marked for number; the verb, however, 
keeps agreeing in number:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ajayon ganjang kivo. //
	\glb Aja-yon gan-ye-ang kivo //
	\glc play-\TsgN{} child-\Pl{}-\Aarg{} small //
	\glft `The small children are playing.' //
\endgl
	
\a\begingl
	\gla Ajayon ganang-ikan kivo. //
	\glb Aja-yon gan-ang-ikan kivo. //
	\glc play-\TsgN{} child-\Aarg{}=many small //
	\glft `Many small children are playing.' //
\endgl

\xe

Likewise, when nouns are modified by numerals,\index{numerals} plurality is not 
normally marked again on the noun. In example (\ref{ex:plurnorm}), we see a 
plural noun, and in (\ref{ex:plurnum}) the same phrase is repeated again with 
plurality implied by the use of a numeral; the plural noun itself appears 
unmarked in its singular form in this case.

\pex
\a\label{ex:plurnorm}\begingl
	\gla Ang no vehya sitang-yām nangajas veno nay hiro. //
	\glb Ang no veh-ya.Ø sitang-yām nanga-ye-as veno nay hiro //
	\glc \AgtT{} want build-\TsgM.\Top{} self=\TsgM{}.\Dat{} 
		house-\Pl{}-\Parg{} pretty and new //
	\glft `He wants to build himself pretty new houses.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:plurnum}\begingl
	\gla Ang no vehya sitang-yām nangās sam veno nay hiro. //
	\glb Ang no veh-ya.Ø sitang-yām nanga-as sam veno nay hiro //
	\glc \AgtT{} want build-\TsgM.\Top{} self=\TsgM{}.\Dat{} house-\Parg{} 
		two pretty and new //
	\glft `He wants to build himself two pretty new houses.' //
\endgl

\xe

An exception to this is the use of words for the numeral powers, 
like \xayr{lnF}{lan}{dozen}, \xayr{menNF}{menang}{gross}, 
\xayr{smNF}{samang}{myriad}, etc. in an unspecified way like `dozens 
of people'. In this case, to convey that the numeral is not to be understood as 
a precise value, the modified noun will appear in the plural---even if 
it is a plurale tantum like \xayr{kejnmF}{keynam}{people}:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Bengyon keynamjang menang //
	\glb Beng-yon keynam-ye-ang menang //
	\glc attend-\TsgN{} people-\Pl{}-\Aarg{} gross //
	\glft `Hundreds of people attended.' //
\endgl\xe

\subsection{Case}
\index{cases|(}

As demonstrated in the declension tables at the beginning of this section 
(Figures \ref{fig:anideclcons}–\ref{fig:inandeclvow}), Ayeri's NPs are marked 
for case, which is governed by the verb. Since Ayeri uses a split alignment 
system with some additional complications, it is not very straightforward, in my 
opinion, to use the classical labels of nominative (S/A) and accusative (O), or 
of absolutive (S/P) and ergative (O) for the first two core roles. Hence, I will 
be using the terms `agent' and `patient', which I hope brings about some more 
clarity, especially when discussing the mentioned complications later on.


\subsubsection{Agent}
\index{cases!agent|(}

To quote \citet{fillmore1968}, what I call `agent' here is  
\textcquote[46]{fillmore1968}{the case of the typically animate perceived 
instigator of the action identified by the verb}. \citeauthor{fillmore1968} 
himself qualifies this definition, however, in that the \textcquote[46, 
footnote 31]{fillmore1968}{escape qualification `typically' expresses my 
awareness that contexts which I will say require agents are sometimes occupied 
by `inanimate' nouns like robot or `human institution' nouns like nation}. 
\citet{payne1997} summarizes about prototypical agents with regards to 
their topicality that a \textcquote[151]{payne1997}{less technical way of 
expressing this fact is to say that people identify with and like to talk about 
things that act, move, control events, and have power}.

Agents in Ayeri frequently embody the properties quoted by both 
\citeauthor{fillmore1968} and \citeauthor{payne1997} in this regard, including 
\citeauthor{fillmore1968}'s caveat. However, importantly, `agent' in Ayeri is a 
macrorole that may be applied to, for instance, instruments, experiencers, and 
less typical actors as well, namely, in absence of more prototypical 
candidates for agenthood in a sentence. It thus comes very close to a 
nominative, except that it does not need to be locus of the sentence's 
topic\index{topic}---although agents very typically are, as 
\citet[151]{payne1997} goes on to note.\footnote{This is the main reason I spoke 
of `complications' above: Ayeri's notion of `subject' is somewhat problematic 
due to topicalization, which is why I try to avoid complicating terminology by 
using `nominative' for agent topics and `ergative' for agent non-topics, and 
`accusative' for patient non-topics and `absolutive' for patient topics.} Thus, 
the first NP after the verb in all of the following examples is treated as an 
agent; the agent is marked by the suffix \rayr{/ANF}{-ang} for animate referents 
and the suffix \rayr{/reNF}{-reng} for inanimate referents; names and verbal 
topic agreement are marked by \rayr{ANF}{ang} and \rayr{ENF}{eng}, respectively:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Ang} tinkaya \textbf{{}} \textbf{Yan} kunangley. //
	\glb \textbf{Ang} tinka-ya \textbf{Ø} \textbf{Yan} kunang-ley //
	\glc \textbf{\AgtT{}} open-\TsgM{} \textbf{\Top{}} \textbf{Yan} 
		door-\PargI{} //
	\glft `Yan opens the door.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Le tinkaya \textbf{ayonang} kunang. //
	\glb Le tinka-ya \textbf{ayon-ang} kunang-Ø //
	\glc \PatT{} open-\TsgM{} \textbf{man-\Aarg{}} door-\Top{} //
	\glft `The door is opened by a/the man',\\
		or: `The door, a/the man opens it.' //
\endgl

		\TsgM{}.\Top{} //

		or: `Because of them, Yan opens the door.' //

about which a judgement is made is also assigned the agent case:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Tinkayreng} tado. //
	\glb \textbf{Tinkay-reng} tado //
	\glc \textbf{key-\AargI{}} old //
	\glft `The key is old.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Ang} \textbf{Yan} nimpayās ban. //
	\glb \textbf{Ang} \textbf{Yan} nimpaya-as ban //
	\glc \textbf{\Aarg{}} \textbf{Yan} runner-\Parg{} good //
	\glft `Yan is a good runner.' //
\endgl

\xe

\index{cases!agent|)}

With regards to constituents' roles in ditransitive verb frames, donors are 
represented by agents in Ayeri as well, since they are the origin of whatever 
is conceptually passed on to the recipient party:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le ilya \textbf{ang} \textbf{Yan} tinkay yam Cānlay. //
	\glb Le il-ya \textbf{ang} \textbf{Yan} tinkay-Ø yam Cānlay //
	\glc \PatT{} give-\TsgM{} \textbf{\Aarg{}} \textbf{Yan} key-\Top{} 
		\Dat{} Cānlay //
	\glft `The key, Yan gives it to Cānlay.' //
\endgl\xe

\subsubsection{Patient}
\index{cases!patient|(}

Patients are less of a definitional problem than agents in Ayeri, since in 
transitive sentences, they are very typically undergoers, that is, the 
constituent that is acted on or affected by the action expressed by the verb. 
This is the default case assigned to objects---but also to predicative 
nominals. In ditransitive sentences, the theme is represented by the patient. 
Animate patients are marked by \rayr{/AsF}{-as}, inanimate ones with 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley}; for names and verbal topic agreement, the markers are 
\rayr{s}{sa} and \rayr{le}{le}, respectively:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang silvye {} Briha \textbf{sa} \textbf{Taryan}. //
	\glb Ang silv-ye Ø Briha \textbf{sa} \textbf{Taryan} //
	\glc \AgtT{} see-\TsgF{} \Top{} Briha \textbf{\Parg{}} \textbf{Taryan}//
	\glft `Briha sees Taryan.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Sa} manye ang Briha \textbf{{}} \textbf{Taryan}. //
	\glb \textbf{Sa} man-ye ang Briha \textbf{Ø} \textbf{Taryan} //
	\glc \textbf{\PatT{}} greet-\TsgF{} \Aarg{} Briha \textbf{\Top{}} 
		\textbf{Taryan} //
	\glft `Taryan is greeted by Briha',\\
		or: `Taryan, Briha greets him.' //
\endgl

\xe

\pex~
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang rimaye {} Briha \textbf{kunangley} //
	\glb Ang rima-ye Ø Briha \textbf{kunang-ley} //
	\glc \AgtT{} close-\TsgF{} \Top{} Briha \textbf{door-\PargI{}} //
	\glft `Briha closes a/the door.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Le} rimaye ang Briha \textbf{kunang} //
	\glb \textbf{Le} rima-ye ang Briha \textbf{kunang-Ø} //
	\glc \textbf{\PatTI{}} close-\TsgF{} \Aarg{} Briha 
		\textbf{door-\Top{}} //
	\glft `The door is closed by Briha',\\
		or: `The door, Briha closes it.' //
\endgl

\xe

\ex~
\begingl
	\gla Ang ilya {} Taryan \textbf{koyaley} yam Kandan. //
	\glb Ang il-ya Ø Taryan \textbf{koya-ley} yam Kandan //
	\glc \AgtT{} give-\TsgM{} \Top{} Taryan \textbf{book-\PargI{}} \Dat{} 
		Kandan //
	\glft `Taryan gives Kandan a book.' //
\endgl

\xe

As the translations of the examples above show, topicalizing the patient can be 
used to create an effect similar to English's passive voice, except that the 
patient will not become marked by the agent case---this is a notable difference 
from the nominative. Even if the agent NP is omitted, the patient NP will not 
be changed to the agent case, since that would reverse the direction of action:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Manya sa Taryan. ≠ Manya ang Taryan. //
	\glb Man-ya sa Taryan {} Man-ya ang Taryan //
	\glc greet-\TsgM{} \Parg{} Taryan {} greet-\TsgM{} \Aarg{} Taryan //
	\glft `Taryan is greeted.' ≠ `Taryan greets.' //
\endgl\xe

This example shows that the case of the NP will not change, however, the 
verb will: it now agrees with the next argument in line, the patient NP. It will 
not do so, however, if the order of arguments is just scrambled, as 
exemplified by the following example. This is to say that the verb does not 
simply agree with whichever NP follows it, even if it can be assumed that verb 
agreement in Ayeri developed along similar lines in-world, which will become 
especially apparent in the discussion of pronouns. 

\tikzstyle{every picture}+=[remember picture]
\ex[aboveglftskip=2em]\begingl
	\gla Sa manye {} Taryan ang Briha. //
	\glb Sa man-ye Ø Taryan ang Briha //
	\glc \PatT{} greet\tikz\node[na](target){-\TsgF{}}; \Top{} Taryan 
		\Aarg{} \tikz\node[na](controller){Briha}; //
	\glft `Taryan is greeted by Briha',\\
		or: `Taryan, Briha greets him.' //
\endgl\xe
\begin{tikzpicture}[overlay]
	\coordinate [below=.25em of controller] (A);
	\coordinate [below=1em of controller] (B);
	\coordinate [below=1em of target] (C);
	\coordinate [below=.25em of target] (D);
	\draw [-latex] (A) -- (B) -- (C) -- (D);
	\node (label) at ($(B)!0.5!(C)$) [below] {\tiny\itshape person 
		agreement};
\end{tikzpicture}
%
Besides being the default case for objects, the patient case is also assigned 
to predicative nominals, by analogy with transitive sentences and in spite of 
the likening nature of the construction:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang Yan \textbf{nimpayās} ban. //
	\glb Ang Yan \textbf{nimpaya-as} ban //
	\glc \Aarg{} Yan \textbf{runner-\Parg{}} good //
	\glft `Yan is a good runner.' //
\endgl\xe

\index{cases!patient|)}

\subsubsection{Dative}
\index{cases!dative|(}

The most typical use of the dative is for the recipient NP in a ditransitive 
clause; as such, it may be a recipient proper or the entity to whose benefit 
the action is carried out. A number of transitive verbs also use the dative 
for their object, for example, when it is the target of address. The dative can 
furthermore be used to mark movement toward a place. The case suffix for 
datives is \rayr{/ymF}\fw{-yam} for both animate and inanimate entities. Names 
and verbal topic agreement are marked equally by \rayr{ymF}{yam}. Verbs do not 
exhibit person agreement with dative NPs, since experiencers are treated as 
agents.

\pex\label{ex:datregular}
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang ilya {} Taryan koyaley \textbf{ayonyam}. //
	\glb Ang il-ya Ø Taryan koya-ley \textbf{ayon-yam} //
	\glc \AgtT{} give-\TsgM{} \Top{} Taryan book-\PargI{} 
		\textbf{man-\Dat{}} //
	\glft `Taryan gives a book to the man.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang ilya {} Taryan koyaley \textbf{yam} \textbf{Kandan}. //
	\glb Ang il-ya Ø Taryan koya-ley \textbf{yam} \textbf{Kandan} //
	\glc \AgtT{} give-\TsgM{} \Top{} Taryan book-\PargI{} \textbf{\Dat{}} 
		\textbf{Kandan} //
	\glft `Taryan gives Kandan a book.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Yam} ilya ang Taryan koyaley \textbf{ayon}. //
	\glb \textbf{Yam} il-ya ang Taryan koya-ley \textbf{ayon-Ø} //
	\glc \textbf{\DatT{}} give-\TsgM{} \Aarg{} Taryan book-\PargI{} 
		\textbf{man-\Top{}} //
	\glft `The man is given a book by Taryan',\\
		or: `The man, Taryan gives him a book.' //
\endgl

\xe

The three examples in (\ref{ex:datregular}) show the regular use of the dative 
as the case the recipient of the theme appears in. What distinguishes Ayeri 
from a pure split-S language is that all constituents can serve as topics, not 
just agents and patients with regards to their function as syntactic subjects. 
Thus, it is also possible for dative NPs to appear as topics---person 
agreement is unaffected by this, though. The following example shows the 
addressee of a speech act in the dative case; the message is treated as the 
theme which is passed on:

\ex
\begingl
	\gla Ang ningye māva ninganas \textbf{ganyam} yena. //
	\glb Ang ning-ye māva-Ø ningan-as \textbf{gan-yam} yena //
	\glc \AgtT{} tell-\TsgF{} mother-\Top{} story-\Parg{} 
		\textbf{child-\Dat{}} \TsgF{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `The mother tells her child a story.' //
\endgl
\xe

As mentioned above, the dative can also take on an allative meaning insofar as 
it marks the target of a motion, as displayed in (\ref{ex:datloc}). As an 
extention of this purpose, the adpositional object may as well appear in the 
dative, since Ayeri cannot distinguish, for instance, `up' from `to the top of' 
with just the preposition, in this case \xayr{liNF}{ling}{on top of}. With the 
adpositional object in the locative case (see below), the phrase in 
(\ref{ex:datlocprep}) would imply that the man were literally going to the top 
of the temple, that is, possibly ending up on its roof.

\pex
\a\label{ex:datloc}\begingl
	\gla Ang nimpye lay \textbf{māvayam} yena. //
	\glb Ang nimp-ye lay-Ø \textbf{māva-yam} yena //
	\glc \AgtT{} run-\TsgF{} girl-\Top{} \textbf{mother-\Dat{}} 
		\TsgF{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `The girl runs to her mother.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:datlocprep}\begingl
	\gla Ang saraya ayon manga ling \textbf{natrangyam}. //
	\glb Ang sara-ya ayon-Ø manga ling \textbf{natrang-yam} //
	\glc \AgtT{} go-\TsgM{} man-\Top{} \Dyn{} top \textbf{temple-\Dat{}} //
	\glft `The man goes up to the temple.' //
\endgl

\xe

\index{cases!dative|)}

\subsubsection{Genitive}
\index{cases!genitive|(}

The genitive is used to mark possessors; attributive genitives follow the 
possessee. It can also be used for ablative meanings, that is, to mark the place 
from which a motion originates, in analogy to the dative's allative use. 
The genitive is marked on common nouns with the suffix \rayr{/n}{-na}. If a 
noun stem ends in a consonant, the marker becomes \rayr{/En}{-ena}, compare 
Figures \ref{fig:anideclcons}–\ref{fig:inandeclvow} above. Names and verbal 
topic agreement are marked by \rayr{n}{na}. There is no animacy distinction in 
the genitive case.

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Pakur ledanang \textbf{netuna} nā //
	\glb Pakur ledan-ang \textbf{netu-na} nā //
	\glc sick friend-\Aarg{} \textbf{brother-\Gen{}} \Fsg{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `My brother's friend is sick.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Kopo dilengyereng \textbf{ajānena} //
	\glb Kopo dileng-ye-reng \textbf{ajān-ena} //
	\glc difficult rule-\Pl{}-\AargI{} \textbf{game-\Gen{}} //
	\glft `The rules of the game are difficult.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang nakasyo tamo ibangya \textbf{na} \textbf{Niyas}. //
	\glb Ang nakas-yo tamo-Ø ibang-ya \textbf{na} \textbf{Niyas} //
	\glc \AgtT{} grow-\TsgN{} wheat-\Top{} field-\Loc{} \textbf{\Gen} 
		\textbf{Niyas} //
	\glft `There is wheat growing on Niyas's field.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Na} nakasyo tamoang ibangya \textbf{{}} \textbf{Niyas}. //
	\glb \textbf{Na} nakas-yo tamo-ang ibang-ya \textbf{Ø} \textbf{Niyas} //
	\glc \textbf{\GenT{}} grow-\TsgN{} wheat-\Aarg{} field-\Loc{} 
		\textbf{\Top} \textbf{Niyas} //
	\glft `Regarding Niyas, there is wheat growing on his field.' //
\endgl

\xe

These examples show the regular use of the genitive as a marker of possession. 
The following examples, on the other hand, show the genitive in its ablative 
function, first without qualification by a preposition, then with the 
preposition \xayr{AvnF}{avan}{at the bottom of}, which together with the 
genitive assumes the meaning `down from':

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang sahaya {} Vetayan \textbf{rimanena}. //
	\glb Ang saha-ya Ø Vetayan \textbf{riman-ena} //
	\glc \AgtT{} come-\TsgM{} \Top{} Vetayan \textbf{city-\Gen{}} //
	\glft `Vetayan comes from the city.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Sahu manga avan \textbf{mehirena}, Niva! //
	\glb Saha-u manga avan \textbf{mehir-ena}, Niva //
	\glc come-\Imp{} \Dyn{} at.bottom \textbf{tree-\Gen{}}, Niva //
	\glft `Come down from the tree, Niva!' //
\endgl

\xe

\index{cases!genitive|)}

\subsubsection{Locative}
\index{cases!locative|(}

The locative marks basic locations, often the default that is associated with a 
verb. It is also the case in which adpositional objects normally appear, 
besides the special cases using the dative and the genitive mentioned above. 
Common nouns are marked by \rayr{/y}{-ya};\footnote{Older texts still exhibit 
an allomorph \rayr{/E\_a}{-ea}, used especially in combination with the plural 
suffix \rayr{/ye}, giving \rayr{/yee\_a}{-yēa}. The modern language uses 
\rayr{/yey}{-jya}.} names and verbal topic agreement use the marker 
\rayr{y}{ya}. There is no difference made between animate and inanimate 
referents in the locative.

\pex\label{ex:locplain}
\a\label{ex:locnedra}\begingl
	\gla Ang nedraya paray \textbf{hinya} //
	\glb Ang nedra-ya paray-Ø \textbf{hin-ya} //
	\glc \AgtT{} sit-\TsgM{} cat-\Top{} \textbf{box-\Loc{}} //
	\glft `The cat sits in the box.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:locnara}\begingl
	\gla Ang naraya {} Ajān \textbf{ya} \textbf{Kaman} //
	\glb Ang nara-ya Ø Ajān \textbf{ya} \textbf{Kaman} //
	\glc \AgtT{} speak-\TsgM{} \Top{} Ajān \textbf{\Loc{}} \textbf{Kaman} //
	\glft `Ajān speaks to Kaman.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:locmit}\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Ya} mica ang Kaman \textbf{{}} \textbf{Visamhinang} //
	\glb \textbf{Ya} mit-ya ang Kaman \textbf{Ø} \textbf{Visamhinang} //
	\glc \textbf{\LocT{}} live-\TsgM{} \Aarg{} Kaman \textbf{\Top{}} 
		\textbf{Visamhinang} //
	\glft `Kaman lives in Visamhinang',\\
		or: `Visamhinang is where Kaman lives.' //
\endgl

\xe

The example sentences in (\ref{ex:locplain}) show locative NPs that are not 
further specified by adpositions so that the correct interpretation may be 
dependent on context and the experience of the addressee. Example 
(\ref{ex:locnedra}) is an instance of this circumstance, insofar as experience 
tells that cats like to sit inside boxes, so further specifying the position 
with the preposition \xayr{koNF}{kong}{inside} would be emphasizing that the cat 
is not sitting just anywhere, but really \emph{inside} the box as opposed to on 
top of it, for instance. The following example has the cat sitting on top of the 
box:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang nedraya paray ling hinya. //
	\glb Ang nedra-ya paray-Ø ling hin-ya //
	\glc \AgtT{} sit-\TsgM{} cat-\Top{} on.top box-\Loc{} //
	\glft `The cat sits on the box.' //
\endgl\xe

Ayeri also has a number of postpositions, which does not change marking on the 
adpositional object, however:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang mican edaya tenyanya tan pesan. //
	\glb Ang mit-yan edaya tenyan-ya tan pesan //
	\glc \AgtT{} live-\TplM{} here death-\Loc{} \TplM{}.\Gen{} until //
	\glft `They lived here until their death.' //
\endgl\xe

\index{cases!locative|)}

\subsubsection{Causative}
\index{cases!causative|(}

The causative marks the cause or causer of an action, the instigator or the 
reason on behalf of which an agent is acting. It is thus similar to the agent 
case, though it does not replace it in Ayeri; verbs do not exhibit person 
agreement with causers even though their action logically supersedes or precedes 
that of the agent in the embedded event. \citeauthor{dixon2000} writes that a 
\textcquote[30]{dixon2000}{causer refers to someone or something (which can be 
an event or state) that initiates or controls the activity. This is the defining 
property of the syntactic--semantic function A (transitive subject)}. According 
to \citet[176]{comrie1989}, the causee---the agent of the event controlled by 
the causer---normally takes the highest place in hierarchy of syntactic 
constituents that is not already filled, in this case, by the causer. This 
observation, however, is complicated by Ayeri's more or less semantics-based 
case marking as well as topicalization. In the following, I will simply give 
examples of nominal marking for cause as before; a discussion of the 
morphosyntax of Ayeri's morphological causative constructions will be deferred 
to the section on valency-increasing operations.

Causers or causes are marked by \rayr{/Is}{-isa} for common nouns; names and 
verbal topic agreement use the marker \rayr{saa}{sā}. As stated above, verbs do 
not agree with causers even though they have agent-like semantics. There is no 
animacy distinction in the marking of causers.

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang rua sarāyn \textbf{seyaranisa}. //
	\glb Ang rua sara-ayn.Ø \textbf{seyaran-isa} //
	\glc \AgtT{} must leave=\Fpl{}.\Top{} \textbf{rain-\Caus{}} //
	\glft `We had to leave due to the rain.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang yomāy edaya \textbf{sā} \textbf{Apican}. //
	\glb Ang yoma-ay.Ø edaya \textbf{sā} \textbf{Apican} //
	\glc \AgtT{} be=\Fsg{}.\Top{} here \textbf{\Caus{}} \textbf{Apican} //
	\glft `I am here because of Apican.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:caustop}\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Sā} nimpvāng hakasley \textbf{yan}. //
	\glb \textbf{Sā} nimp-vāng hakas-ley \textbf{yan.Ø} //
	\glc \textbf{\CauT{}} run=\Ssg{}.\Aarg{} mile-\PargI{} 
		\textbf{\TplM{}.\Top{}} //
	\glft `You run a mile because of them',\\
		or: `Due to them, you run a mile',\\
		or: `They make you run a mile.' //
\endgl

\xe

Regarding the typological oddities mentioned above, example (\ref{ex:caustop}) 
shows what happens in Ayeri with regards to the marking of causers. 
Essentially, the causer topic was grammaticalized to express a causation 
relationship.

\index{cases!causative|)}

\subsubsection{Instrumental}
\index{cases!instrumental|(}

The instrumental marks the means by which an action is carried out by an agent. 
This can be a tool as well as an animate being by whose help the action is 
brought about. The instrumental thus, in effect, marks secondary agents; verbs, 
however, never show person agreement with instrumental NPs. Common nouns are 
marked by \rayr{/ri}{-ri} when ending in a vowel and with \rayr{/Eri}{-eri} 
when ending in a consonant; names and verbal topic agreement receive marking by 
\rayr{ri}{ri}. With nouns ending in \fw{-e}, as well as the plural marker 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye}, there is variation regarding whether \rayr{/ri}{-ri} or 
\rayr{/Eri}{-eri} is used, so that in the case of the plural marker both 
\rayr{/yeri}{-yeri} and \rayr{/yeeri}{-yēri} occur. In passive-like 
constructions, it is not grammatical to reintroduce the agent as an 
instrumental; the agent simply remains in the clause in this case, though as a 
non-topic constituent.

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang visye {} Pila seygoley \textbf{tihangeri} yena. //
	\glb Ang vis-ye Ø Pila seygo-ley \textbf{tihang-eri} yena. //
	\glc \AgtT{} cut-\TsgF{} \Top{} Pila apple-\PargI{} 
		\textbf{knife-\Ins{}} \TsgF{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `Pila cuts an apple with her knife.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang lihoyya-ma badan \textbf{nihanyeri} \textbf{(nihanyēri)}. //
	\glb Ang liha-oy-ya-ma badan-Ø \textbf{nihan-ye-ri} 
		\textbf{(nihan-ye-eri)} //
	\glc \AgtT{} earn-\Neg{}-\TsgM{}=enough father-\Top{} 
		\textbf{nihan-\Pl{}-\Ins} \textbf{(nihan-\Pl{}-\Ins)} //
	\glft `Father did not earn enough with his fruits.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang lingya {} Mindan mehiras \textbf{ri} \textbf{Kadijān}. //
	\glb Ang ling-ya Ø Mindan mehir-as \textbf{ri} \textbf{Kadijān}. //
	\glc \AgtT{} climb.up-\TsgM{} \Top{} Mindan tree-\Parg{} 
		\textbf{\Ins{}} \textbf{Kadijān} //
	\glft `Mindan climbs a tree with Kadijān's help.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla \textbf{Ri} tavya gino ang Kan \textbf{nimpur}. //
	\glb \textbf{Ri} tav-ya gino ang Kan \textbf{nimpur-Ø} //
	\glc \textbf{\InsT{}} become-\TsgM{} drunk \Aarg{} Kan 
		\textbf{wine-\Top{}} //
	\glft `Kan becomes drunk on the wine', \\
		or: `The wine, Kan becomes drunk on it.' //
\endgl

\xe

Theoretically, it should be possible as well to use the instrumental together 
with prepositions for some kind of prolative meaning. The adposition would 
indicate the place \emph{by way of} a motion is happening:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang pukay manga luga \textbf{lahaneri}. //
	\glb Ang puk-ay.Ø manga luga \textbf{lahan-eri} //
	\glc \AgtT{} jump-\Fsg{}.\Top{} \Dyn{} top \textbf{fence-\Ins{}} //
	\glft `I jump over the fence.' //
\endgl\xe

This use of the instrumental is unattested in previous translations into Ayeri, 
however, but could be considered a stylistic alternative---in the case of the 
example above, to a construction with the word for `over', 
\rayr{EjrrY}{eyrarya}:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang pukay manga eyrarya lahanya. //
	\glb Ang puk-ay.Ø manga eyrarya lahan-ya //
	\glc \AgtT{} jump-\Fsg{}.\Top{} \Dyn{} over fence-\Loc{} //
	\glft `I jump over the fence.' //
\endgl\xe

A more literal translation of \rayr{mN lug lhneri}{manga luga lahaneri} is `by 
way of the top of the fence', though without the verbosity of the English 
translation, as both ways to express the circumstance are about equally long in 
Ayeri.

\index{cases!instrumental|)}

\subsubsection{Case-unmarked nouns}

Case endings are applied to nouns in Ayeri only if the word is actually in a 
syntactic context where case can be applied. Thus, the unmarked form is the 
citation form, not the one declined for agent. This is the case when addressing 
people---one might speak of an unmarked vocative:

\pex
\a\label{ex:vocnoun}\begingl
	\gla Raypu, \textbf{petāya}! //
	\glb Raypa-u, \textbf{petāya} //
	\glc stop-\Imp{}, \textbf{idiot} //
	\glft `Stop it, you idiot!' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:vocname}\begingl
	\gla Sahu edaya, \textbf{Diras}! //
	\glb Saha-u edaya, \textbf{Diras} //
	\glc come-\Imp{} here, \textbf{Diras} //
	\glft `Come here, Diras!' //
\endgl
\xe

Imperative forms have underlying second-person agents, so both the `idiot' in 
(\ref{ex:vocnoun}) and Diras in (\ref{ex:vocname}) would be the implied agents 
of their sentences, yet neither the noun nor the name are marked by the agent 
markers \rayr{/ANF}{-ang} and \rayr{ANF}{ang}, respectively. Another case where 
nouns are not necessarily marked for case is attested in translations for the 
prefix \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as though} when the phrase acts as an adverb or an 
object complement:

\pex
\a\label{ex:kuudhr}\begingl
	\gla … nay ang mya rankyon sitanyās \textbf{ku-netu}. //
	\glb … nay ang mya rank-yon.Ø sitanya-as \textbf{ku-netu} //
	\glc … and \AgtT{} be.supposed.to treat-\TplN{}.\Top{} 
		each.other-\Parg{} \textbf{like=brother} //
	\glft `… and they shall treat each other like brothers.'\footnotemark%
	\tc{\citep{benung:udhr}}//
\endgl

\a\label{ex:kukafka}\begingl
	\gla … ang nunaya \textbf{ku-vipin} … //
	\glb … ang nuna-ya.Ø \textbf{ku-vipin} … //
	\glc … \AgtT{} fly-\TsgM{} \textbf{like=bird} … //
	\glft `… he (would) fly like a bird …'%
	\tc{\citep[14]{becker:kafka:imperial}}//
\endgl

\xe

\footnotetext{The original English text this was translated from has 
\textcquote[Article 1]{udhr}{and should act towards one another in a spirit of 
brotherhood}.}

Strikingly, in example (\ref{ex:kuudhr}), \xayr{netu}{netu}{brother} in 
\xayr{ku/netu}{ku-netu}{like brothers} is not even inflected for plural; its 
placement after the object is likely an effect of translation: adverbs 
have a strong tendency to appear right after the verb, and a position 
immediately to the right of the verb is attested for adjectival object 
predicatives as well. In (\ref{ex:kukafka}), on the other hand, 
\xayr{ku/vipinF}{ku-vipin}{like a bird} is feasibly interpretable as an adverb, 
since it follows the verb and acts as a modifier to it, not as a complement.

\subsection{Prefixes on nouns}
\index{prefixes!on nouns|(}

All of the nominal morphology we have so far dealt with in this section was 
suffixing. As mentioned in the previous section 
already (p.~\pageref{nounprefixes}), however, there are also a number of 
prefixes that can be applied to nouns. I have just given two examples of the 
prefix \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as though} above, but \rayr{ku/}{ku-} can 
apply not only to nouns themselves. In fact, it rather attaches to whole NPs, 
which makes it a clitic\index{clitics} according to \citet[117]{klavans1985}, 
and a special clitic in \citeauthor{zwicky1977}'s terminology, since no 
corresponding full form exists in its place, comparable to the English 
possessive clitic \fw{'s}, for instance \parencites[3, 
13]{zwicky1977}[295]{zwicky1985}[510]{zwickypullum1983}. To cite from the Ayeri 
translation of Kafka's short story \enquote{Eine kaiserliche Botschaft} again:

\ex\label{ex:kukafka2}\begingl
	\gla … saylingyāng kovaro naynay, ku-ranyāng palung. //
	\glb … sayling-yāng kovaro naynay, ku-ranya-ang palung //
	\glc … progress=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} easy also, like=nobody-\Aarg{} else //
	\glft `… he also got on easily, like nobody else.'%
	\tc{\citep[12]{becker:kafka:imperial}}//
\endgl\xe

In this example, we can see \rayr{ku/}{ku-} attaching to a properly inflected 
NP adjunct. It is case-marked for agent since it can be understood to refer to 
the verb \xayr{sjliNF/}{sayling-}{progress} in the main clause, insofar 
\xayr{rnYaaNF pluNF}{ranyāng palung}{nobody else} can replace 
\xayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}{he}.

Besides \rayr{ku/}{ku-}, there are also the demonstrative prefixes 
\xayr{d/}{da-}{such}, \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, and \xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}, which 
have already been mentioned in the previous section as well. The demonstrative 
prefixes undergo coalescence with nouns beginning with \fw{a-}, that is, they 
form phonological words with their hosts for all means and purposes. The 
demonstrative prefixes are special clitics as well, since no contemporary free 
form exists.

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla da-nanga kāryo //
	\glb such=house big //
	\glft `such a big house' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla edāyon nake //
	\glb eda-ayon nake //
	\glc this=man tall //
	\glft `this tall man' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla ada-envan alingo //
	\glb that=woman clever //
	\glft `that clever woman' //
\endgl

\xe

Moreover, there is a prefix \rayr{me/}{mə-} in complementary distribution with 
the demonstrative prefixes, which adds a meaning along the lines of `just any', 
`whatsoever', `some' to the noun. Note that this prefix is distinct from the 
morpheme indicating an inspecific quantity.

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla Ang lampyo mə-veney kayvo kirinya. //
	\glb Ang lamp-yo mə-veney-Ø kayvo kirin-ya //
	\glc \AgtT{} walk-\TsgN{} some=dog-\Top{} along street-\Loc{} //
	\glft `Some dog is walking along the street.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Ang noyan mēntānley pegamayayam. //
	\glb Ang no-yan mə-entān-ley pegamaya-yam //
	\glc \AgtT{} want=\TsgM{}.\Top{} some=punishment-\PargI{}

	\glft `They demanded some kind of punishment for the thief.' //
\endgl

\subsection{Compounding}
\index{compounds|(}

With regards to the classification of compounds, \citet{bauer2001} gives some 
helpful typological guidelines. Besides the compound types recognized by 
Sanskrit grammarians---endocentric (\fw{tatpuruṣa}), coordinative 
(\fw{dvandva}), adjectival-endo\-cent\-ric (\fw{karmadhāraya}), and 
exocentric (\fw{bahuvrīhi})---he also adds synthetic compounds, which Sanskrit 
did not have \citep[697]{bauer2001}. Overall, he finds that determinative, or 
endocentric, compounds are the most common ones in the languages of the world 
\citep[697]{bauer2001}, especially if the head refers to a location or source 
of sorts \citep[702]{bauer2001}.

\citet{gaeta2008}, then, adds to \citeauthor{bauer2001}'s research, based on a 
larger sample of grammars surveyed, that compounds for the largest part 
correlate with the constituent order of the language, both regarding the order 
of verb and object and that of noun and genitive \citep[129--133]{gaeta2008}. 
Mismatches in headedness occur, but appear to constitute the minority of cases 
and may often be explained through historical changes in syntax; he constitutes 
for one that \textcquote[135]{gaeta2008}{morphology is not autonomous from 
syntax}, and that secondly, \textcquote[135]{gaeta2008}{[s]yntax seems to be 
the motor of change, which may be then reflected in compounds}, and lexical 
conservativism causes atavisms to linger on, reflecting the syntax of earlier 
stages of the language \citep[138--139]{gaeta2008}.

\index{typology!of compounds}
For the purpose of gaining at least a little insight into which compounds 
Ayeri allows---besides endocentric compounds---I conducted a small 
(non-exhaustive) survey based on 130 compounds from the Ayeri dictionary 
\citep[Dictionary]{benung}; \autoref{tab:comptyp} shows the various compound 
classes and the number of words for each. `Harmonic' and `disharmonic', 
respectively, refer to the order of elements, which is `harmonic' if following 
the normal constituent order of the language and `disharmonic' if it is at odds 
with it \citep{gaeta2008}.

\end{table}

Unsurprisingly, the largest number of compound nouns in the sample were 
endocentric compounds of the regular kind, which means that, just like genitive 
attributes follow nouns, noun compounds are headed left. Especially compounds 
with adjectives are interesting insofar as this is also the normal order for 
free adjectives, so to illustrate, some tests will be necessary to show that 
these adjectives form a unit with the head noun and are unable to undergo 
comparison, for instance. Synthetic compounds exist in Ayeri and produce nouns. 
These are compounds in which \textcquote[701]{bauer2001}{the modifying element 
in the compound is (usually) interpreted as an argument of the verb from which 
the head is derived}. There are also a number of coordinating compounds; this 
group, however, is lexicalized and not productive. Exocentric compounds 
constitute the minority of the sample. In the following I will give examples for 
each type.

Germanic languages allow compounds of seemingly arbitrary length to be strung 
together, however, Ayeri does not allow things like

\ex\begingl\rc{German}%
	\gla Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitän //
	\glb Donau-dampf-schifffahrt-s-gesellschaft-s-kapitän //
	\glc Danube-steam-shipping-\Gen{}-society-\Gen{}-captain //
	\glft `Captain of the Danube steamshipping society' //
\endgl\xe

German is commonly regarded as especially notorious of this for 
endocentric noun compounds. Ayeri, on the other hand, allows only two elements 
in compounds. Furthermore, this section on compounds is located within the 
section on nouns because Ayeri only possesses compounds involving nouns, and 
the majority of these also results in a noun.

\subsubsection{Endocentric compounds}
\index{compounds!endocentric|(}

To start with the largest group, endocentric/\fw{tatpuruṣa} compounds, the bulk 
of these compounds combines two nouns, one of which is the head which is 
modified by a dependent noun. As Ayeri exhibits a rather strict head-first word 
order, it comes as no surprise, according to \citet{gaeta2008} that most of 
these compounds follow this order strictly: the second noun modifies the first, 
which is opposite of how English, for instance, typically operates:

\pex\label{ex:endonoun}
	\a \makebox[12.2em][l]{\xayr{\larger betjniMpurF}{betaynimpur}{grape}}
		← \xayr{\larger betj}{betay}{berry}
		+ \xayr{\larger niMpurF}{nimpur}{wine}
	\a \makebox[12.2em][l]{\xayr{\larger krirynF}{karirayan}{vertigo}}
		← \xayr{\larger krF}{kar}{fear}
		+ \xayr{\larger IrynF}{irayan}{height}\footnotemark
	\a \makebox[12.2em][l]{\xayr{\larger pikunMdiNF}{pikunanding}{mustache}}
		← \xayr{\larger piku}{piku}{beard}
		+ \xayr{\larger nMdiNF}{nanding}{lips}
	\a \makebox[12.2em][l]{\xayr{\larger tpjperinF}{tapayperin}{sunblind}}
		← \xayr{\larger tpj}{tapay}{screen}
		+ \xayr{\larger perinF}{perin}{sun}
\xe

\footnotetext{\rayr{IrynF}{irayan}, however, is a transparent nominalization of 
\xayr{Irj}{iray}{high}.}

The example words in (\ref{ex:endonoun}) show that the relationships between 
the modifier and the head are various: a grape is a berry \emph{used} to 
make wine from \parencite[compare][702]{bauer2001}; vertigo is the fear 
\emph{of} height; a mustache is a beard \fw{located} over the lips 
\parencite[702]{bauer2001}; and a sunblind is a screen \fw{against} the 
sun. \citet{bauer2001} mentions that \textquote{there may be special 
morphophonemic processes which apply between the elements of compounds}, such as 
\textcquote[695]{bauer2001}{phonological merger[s] between the elements of the 
compound}. This also occasionally happens in Ayeri, as the next few example 
words show:

\pex\label{ex:endonounmod}
	\a \xayr{\larger AvrrnF}{avararan}{wetland} \\
		← \xayr{\larger AvnF}{avan}{ground}
		+ \xayr{\larger rro}{raro}{wet}
		+ \rayr{\larger /AnF}{-an} (\Nmlz{})
	\a \xayr{\larger mehimitFrNF}{mehimitrang}{fiber tree} \\
		← \xayr{\larger mehirF}{mehir}{tree}
		+ \xayr{\larger mitFrNF}{mitrang}{hair, fiber}
	\a \xayr{\larger niNMpinmF}{ningampinam}{bedtime story} \\
		← \xayr{\larger niNnF}{ningan}{story}
		+ \xayr{\larger pinmF}{pinam}{bed}
	\a \xayr{\larger pdilmikYnF}{padilamican}{gravitational force} \\
		← \xayr{\larger pdilnF}{padilan}{attraction}
		+ \xayr{\larger mikYnF}{mican}{force, power}
\xe

There is a modicum of alteration happening in all of the heads of the example 
words in (\ref{ex:endonounmod}), mostly nasals assimilating to the stop or 
nasal which the modifier begins with (/n/~+~/p/~→~/mp/, /n/~+~/m/~→~/m/), 
though \rayr{AvrrnF}{avararan} and \rayr{mehimitFrNF}{mehimitrang} even delete 
whole coda segments.
% Stuff may even be mashed together completely, but examples????
\citet[703]{bauer2001} notes that very commonly, genitive and plural markers 
may form linking elements, though he also gives examples of languages which 
allow other case markers on the modifying element in languages with head-right 
order; individual languages may allow even more case inflection. However, this 
appears not to happen in Ayeri. The only element that comes up time and again 
in between the two halves of compounds is the nominalizer \rayr{/AnF}{-an}, 
which signifies that the head is being formed by a nominalized root, such as in 
\rayr{pdilmikYnF}{padilamican}, where \xayr{pdilnF}{padilan}{attraction} is a 
nominalization of \xayr{pdilF/}{padil-}{attract}, or in 
\rayr{niNMpinmF}{ningampinam}, where \xayr{niNnF}{ningan}{story} is derived 
from the verb \xayr{niNF/}{ning-}{tell}. However, since Ayeri is head-first and 
possessive phrases are dependent marking, genitive or other case marking would 
be expected on the second element, not the first. Case marking on a compound 
does not inflect just the modifier, but the whole NP:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang ningya sipikanena koyabahisena. //
	\glb Ang ning-ya sipik-an-ena koyabahis-ena //
	\glc \AgtT{} talk-\TsgM{}.\Top{} keep-\Nmlz{}-\Gen{} book.day-\Gen{} //
	\glft `He talks about keeping a journal.' //
\endgl\xe

\rayr{koybhisen}{koyabahisena} in this example is not to be interpreted as 
`book of day(s)' but as `of a journal'. Inflection between the parts of a 
compound can happen nonetheless, though. In compounds which are formed ad 
hoc or which are otherwise transparent in their composition, inflection often 
is deferred to the noun head instead of the edge of the compound as a whole; 
the modifier is treated as an adjunct in this case:

\ex\label{ex:nouncompdiv}\begingl
	\gla Sa trayeng tipin ralanyeri mapang yena. //
	\glb Sa tra-yeng tipin-Ø ralan-ye-ri mapang yena //
	\glc \PatT{} scratch=\TsgF{}.\Aarg{} itch-\Top{} nail-\Pl{}-\Ins{} 
		finger \TsgF{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `The itch, she scratches it with her fingernails.' //
\endgl\xe

Besides noun modifiers, there are also compounds where the modifier is an 
adjective. In classical Sanskrit terminology, this type is called 
\fw{karmadhāraya} \citep[698--699]{bauer2001}.\footnote{\citeauthor{bauer2001} 
also mentions that appositional compounds like \fw{maid-servant}, \fw{woman 
doctor} and \fw{fighter-bomber} are counted under this category 
\citep[699]{bauer2001}. Ayeri, however, does not possess such formations in 
particular.} Examples in Ayeri include:

\pex
	\a \makebox[12.5em][l]{\xayr{\larger krFdNirj}{kardangiray}{university}}
		← \xayr{\larger krFdNF}{kardang}{school}
		+ \xayr{\larger Irj}{iray}{high}
	\a \makebox[12.5em][l]{\xayr{\larger mrsFhri}{marashari}{witticism}}
		← \xayr{\larger mrsF}{maras}{phrase}
		+ \xayr{\larger hti}{hati}{pithy}
	\a \makebox[12.5em][l]{\xayr{\larger silFvniknF}{silvanikan}{overview}}
		← \xayr{\larger silFvnF}{silvan}{view}
		+ \xayr{\larger IknF}{ikan}{whole}
	\a \makebox[12.5em][l]{\xayr{\larger vipimkaarY}{vipimakārya}{crow}}
		← \xayr{\larger vipinF}{vipin}{bird}
		+ \xayr{\larger mkaarY}{makārya}{black}
\xe

In all of these cases, the adjective forms a unified lexeme with the head noun, 
hence it is not comparable, for example:

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla *kardangiray-eng \quad{} *kardangiray-vā //
	\glb *kardang-iray-eng \quad{} *kardang-iray-vā //
	\glc *school-high=\Comp{} \quad{} *school-high=\Supl{} //
	%\glft `*higher-school', `*highest-school' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla *marashati-eng \quad{} *marashati-vā //
	\glb *maras-hati-eng \quad{} *maras-hati-vā //
	\glc *phrase-pithy=\Comp{} \quad{} *phrase-pithy=\Supl{} //
	%\glft `*pithier-phrase', `*pithiest-phrase' //
\endgl

\xe

In fact, it is possible to form the expressions \rayr{krFdNirj vaa}{kardangiray 
vā} and \rayr{mrsFhti vaa}{marashati vā}, but they mean `most universities' and 
`most witticisms', respectively; \xayr{/ENF}{-eng}{rather} as a quantifier does 
not combine with nouns. Since the meaning composed from noun--adjective 
compounds is often idiomatic, they also cannot be divided as shown above in 
(\ref{ex:nouncompdiv}), since a \xayr{krFdNirj}{kardangiray}{university} is not 
a \xayr{krFdNF}{kardang}{school} which is \xayr{Irj}{iray}{high} in the literal 
sense, but a school of the highest tier. \rayr{krFdNen Irj}{kardangena iray} 
(school-\Gen{} high), then, can only be interpreted in the literal sense, `of 
the high school', but not as `of the university', which thus can only be 
\rayr{krFdNiryen}{kardangirayena}.

In the sample, there were also a few compounds I categorized as noun–noun 
combinations, which look as though they violate head-first order. All of these 
involve \xayr{sitNF}{sitang}{self} as a modifier:

\pex\label{ex:compsitang}
	\a \makebox[16em][l]{\xayr{\larger sitNFleMtnF}{sitanglentan}{vowel}}
		← \xayr{\larger sitNF}{sitang}{self}
		+ \xayr{\larger leMtnF}{lentan}{sound}
	\a \makebox[16em][l]{\xayr{\larger sitNFpronaanF}{sitangparonān}%
		{self-confidence}}
		← \xayr{\larger sitNF}{sitang}{self}
		+ \xayr{\larger pronaanF}{paronān}{faith}
	\a \makebox[16em][l]{\xayr{\larger sitNFtenYnF}{sitangtenyan}%
		{suicide}}
		← \xayr{\larger sitNF}{sitang}{self}
		+ \xayr{\larger tenYnF}{tenyan}{death}
\xe

\rayr{sitNF}{sitang} does not exist as a noun by itself in Ayeri, the word for 
`self' is its nominalization \rayr{sitNnF}{sitangan}. Nonetheless, it looks 
like it could have plausibly been a noun once. However, this noun 
may have been grammaticalized into a reflexive morpheme of a more 
general kind, which in turn birthed the form \rayr{sitNnF}{sitangan} as a 
renovation.\footnote{A little bit of language history would certainly simplify 
things here and lend them credence. Let us simply assume that 
\rayr{sitNF}{sitang} used to be a noun meaning something like `self' at a 
previous stage of Ayeri and was repurposed as a reflexive prefix. 
\citet{lehmann2015} quotes a few examples of what he calls `autophoric' nouns 
that came to be used as reflexive pronouns in their respective language: 
\textcquote[45--46]{lehmann2015}{Typical examples are Sanskrit \fw{tan} 
`body, person' and \fw{ātmán} `breath, soul', Buginese \fw{elena} `body', 
Okinawan \fw{dūna} `body', !Xu \fw{l’esi} `body', Basque \fw{burua} `head', 
Abkhaz \fw{a-xə̀̀} `the head'. In their respective languages, all these nouns 
are translation equivalents of English \fw{self}}. Thus, it would not be out of 
line at all to assume such a grammaticalization path for Ayeri as well.} The 
reflexive \rayr{sitNF}{sitang} is used---as we have seen in the previous 
chapter---as a prefix, so there are two ways to intepret these formations: 
first, \rayr{sitNF}{sitang} may be the reflexive prefix here and thus the 
compound follows the normal syntactic order; or second, the order of elements 
is reversed and thus may reflect an earlier stage of Ayeri where 
\rayr{sitNF}{sitang} was still a noun and modifiers could still appear in front 
of their heads, at least optionally so \citep[133--137]{gaeta2008}.

There are a number of genuinely reversed endocentric compounds as well, 
however, in which the modifier comes first and the head last. Since there are 
only a few of these, I will give all of them in the following example:

\pex
	\a \makebox[15em][l]{\xayr{\larger bript}{baripata}{ground meat}}
		← \xayr{\larger bri}{bari}{meat}
		+ \xayr{\larger pt}{pata}{mash}
	\a \makebox[15em][l]{\xayr{\larger maavgneNF}{māvaganeng}{mother's 
		siblings}}
		← \xayr{\larger maav}{māva}{mother}
		+ \xayr{\larger gneNF}{ganeng}{siblings}
	\a \makebox[15em][l]{\xayr{\larger mtinMdiNF}{matinanding}{labia}}
		← \xayr{\larger mtiknF}{matikan}{hot}
		+ \xayr{\larger nMdiNF}{nanding}{lips}
	\a \makebox[15em][l]{\xayr{\larger muyvirNF}{muyavirang}{brass}}
		← \xayr{\larger muy}{muya}{false}
		+ \xayr{\larger AvirNF}{avirang}{gold}
	\a \makebox[15em][l]{\xayr{\larger 
		tonisjtNF}{tonisaytang}{self-assured}}
		← \xayr{\larger tonis}{tonisa}{assured}
		+ \ques{}\,\xayr{\larger sitNnF}{sitangan}{self}
\xe

Given the discussion of \rayr{sitNF}{sitang} above, a word among the examples 
above that is not too clear is \rayr{tonisjtNF}{tonisaytang} which appears to 
contain a deviant form of either \rayr{sitNF}{sitang} or 
\rayr{sitNnF}{sitangan}, which is preceded by the adjective 
\xayr{tonis}{tonisa}{assured, ascertained}.

All of the previously mentioned compounds involving nominal elements formed 
nouns, however, there are also a few compounds which are denominal in the 
sample. This process is not productive, however, and interestingly, only 
noun–adjective combinations appear in this group:

\pex
	\a \xayr{\larger mirMpluj}{mirampaluy}{otherwise} \\
		← \xayr{\larger mirnF}{miran}{way}
		+ \ques{}\,\xayr{\larger pluNF}{palung}{different}
	\a \xayr{\larger pdbnY}{padabanya}{insane} \\
		← \xayr{\larger pdNF}{padang}{mind}
		+ \xayr{\larger bny}{banaya}{sick}
	\a \xayr{\larger teMkris/}{tenkarisa-}{be frightened 
		to death} \\
		← \xayr{\larger tenF}{ten}{life}
		+ \xayr{\larger kris}{karisa}{frightened}
\xe

\rayr{mirMpluj}{mirampaluy} is an adverb, the modifier probably a mangling of 
\rayr{pluNF}{palung}; \rayr{pdbnY}{padabanya} is an adjective meaning `insane' 
rather than the expected `insanity' (instead: \rayr{pdbnYaanF}{padabanyān}); 
and \rayr{teMkris/}{tenkarisa-} acts as a verb, possibly from conversion or 
reinterpretation, since the suffix \rayr{/Is}{-isa} also forms morphological 
causatives of a number of verbs.

Besides these irregularities, there is also at least one noun compound which 
uses a postposition as an adjectival modifier:

\ex
	\xayr{\larger silFvMkjvj}{silvankayvay}{blindness} 
	← \xayr{\larger silFvnF}{silvan}{sight}
	+ \xayr{\larger kjvj}{kayvay}{without}
\xe

This compound must be derived from the phrase \xayr{silFvnFy kjvj}{silvanya 
kayvay}{without sight} (see-\Nmlz{}-\Loc{} without), though here as well, the 
word roots are simply juxtaposed, as noted above is the common way to form 
compounds in Ayeri.
