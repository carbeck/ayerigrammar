\chapter{Preface}

This is my latest attempt to write a grammar of Ayeri, a fictional language 
which I have been developing since December 2003. Getting to work on grammar 
writing again was triggered by a growing dissatisfaction with not having a 
central place of documentation, when the first thing people look for on my 
website is often the grammar, incomplete as well as partially inaccurate and 
outdated as it may be. In addition to that, there was a seminar on fictional 
languages at the University of Tübingen, Germany, in the summer semester of 
2016 \autocite{buch2016ss}. Ayeri was one of the languages that was chosen for 
students to explore and evaluate.

The student group who worked on Ayeri came to the conclusion that its
documentation is severely lacking in the description of basic elements and
assumptions, since whole chapters of the grammar had been missing to date
(\cite[12]{boga2016}).\footnote{\xayr{kuːtnsF/IknF}{Kutānas-ikan}{thanks a lot}
to Bella Boga, Madita Breuninger, Thora Daneyko, and Martina Stama-Kirr for
their hard work on making sense of my published materials in spite of
information being scattered all over the place, as well as their providing me
with the presentation concluding their group work.} This is to say that
previous attempts of writing a full-fledged grammar of Ayeri have been
incomplete due to loss of enthusiasm and creeping neglect.

Although the \tit{Ayeri Grammar} has so far been lying dormant for five years,
I have written a whole number of blog articles detailing various grammatical
issues \autocite[Blog]{benung}. These articles have been taken into
consideration here. This grammar writing attempt is thus not only a transferral
to a different typesetting system, but constitutes an extension to previous
formal documentation as well.
