\chapter{Morphological Typology}
\index{typology!of morphemes|(}

The first chapter dealt with the smallest constituent parts of words---speech 
sounds, which ones there are, and how they assemble into valid words. 
Consequentially, the following chapters will be about the next step up from 
this: morphemes, the atoms of meaning. First we will have a more general look 
at which kinds of morphemes there are, and then look at them more closely by 
part of speech. This chapter on morphological typology will first deal with 
general questions about Ayeri's degree of synthesis, and then will try 
to answer questions about the kinds of processes the various morpheme classes 
carry out in the language.
