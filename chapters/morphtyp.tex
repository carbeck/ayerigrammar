\chapter{Morphological typology}
\label{ch:morphtyp}
\index{typology|(}

The first chapter dealt with the smallest constituent parts of words---speech
sounds, which ones there are, and how they assemble into valid words.
Consequently, the following two chapters will be about the next step up from
this: morphemes, the atoms of meaning. First, we will have a more general look
at which kinds of morphemes there are, and then look at them more closely by
part of speech: what is their distribution, and how are morphemes put together
to form inflected words? This chapter on morphological typology will first deal
with general questions about Ayeri's degree of synthesis, and then will try to
answer questions about the functions various kinds of inflection carry out in
the language. In a prelude to both the morphology and syntax chapters, special
attention is given to discussing why certain affixes and `small words' should
be treated as clitics.

\section{Typology}
\label{sec:typology}

For the largest part, Ayeri is an \emph{agglutinating}\index{agglutination} 
language. \citet{comrie1989} says of agglutinating languages that in these, 
typically,

\blockcquote[43--44]{comrie1989}{a word may consist of more than one morpheme,
but the boundaries between morphemes in the word are always clear-cut;
moreover, a given morpheme has at least a reasonably invariant shape, so that
the identification of morphemes in terms of their phonetic shape is also
straightforward [\dots] As is suggested by the term agglutinating (cf. Latin
\fw{gluten} `glue'), it is as if the various affixes were just glued on one 
after the other (or one before the other, with prefixes).}

In Ayeri, root morphemes are modified by affixes for the purposes of inflection
and derivation, and these affixes, in the form of suffixes\index{suffixes} more
specifically, can be stacked, especially on verbs. Indeed, they vary little, so
that they are always easily recognizable. Suffixation in Ayeri is especially
prominent with verbs\index{verbs}, as (\ref{ex:suffixation}) shows.

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:suffixation}%
\begingl
	\gla Le @ kondasayāng hemaye pruyya nay napayya kayvay. //
	\glb le= kond-asa=yāng hema-ye-Ø pruy-ya nay napay-ya kayvay //
	\glc \PatTI{}= eat-\Hab{}=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} egg-\Pl{}-\Top{} salt-\Loc{} 
		and pepper-\Loc{} without //
	\glft `He always eats his eggs without salt and pepper.' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

The verb root \xayr{koMd/}{kond-}{eat} is inflected here for a habitual action
with the suffix \rayr{/As}{-asa}, and also carries a pronominal
clitic,\index{clitics} \rayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}, marking a third person singular
masculine agent. With the notable exception of pronouns\index{pronouns} and related pronominal
clitics\index{clitics}, affixes tend to encode a single grammatical function. The examples in
(\ref{ex:inflectable}) illustrate that verbs are not the only part of speech
which can inflect; nouns\index{nouns}, adjectives\index{adjectives}, and the relativizer\index{pronouns!relative} can do
so as well.

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:inflectable}
\a\label{ex:letters}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ mətahanay tamanyeley yeyam. //
	\glb ang= mə-tahan=ay.Ø taman-ye-ley yeyam. //
	\glc \AgtT{}= \Pst{}-write=\Fsg{}.\Top{} letter-\Pl{}-\PargI{} 
		\TsgF{}.\Dat{} //
	\glft `I wrote letters to her.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:adjinfl}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ koronya Kaman apyanas palayoy. //
	\glb ang= koron-ya Kaman apyan-as palayoy //
	\glc \AgtT{}= know-\TsgM{} Kaman joke-\Parg{} funny-\Neg{} //
	\glft `Kaman knows an unfunny joke.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:relative}\begingl
	\gla Le @ turayāng taman sinā ang @ ningay tamala vās. //
	\glb le= tura=yāng taman-Ø si-Ø-na ang= ning=ay.Ø tamala vās //

		\Rel{}-\PatTI{}-\Gen{} \AgtT{}= tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday 
		\Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `The letter which I told you about yesterday, he sent it.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

The principle of not conflating several grammatical functions into a single
suffix\index{suffixes} can be observed in (\ref{ex:letters}) regarding the word
\xayr{tmnFyelej}{tamanyeley}{letters}, in which the plural marker 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye} is distinct from the inanimate-patient case marker 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley} (the latter, however, conflates animacy and case. Strictly 
speaking, the pronoun \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} is also composed, namely of
the third-person feminine base form \rayr{ye}{ye} and the dative case marker
\rayr{/ymF}{yam}. Example (\ref{ex:relative}) is one we have already 
encountered before (\autoref{doublerel}, p.~\pageref{doublerel}). Here, the
relative pronoun\index{pronouns!relative}, \xayr{sinaa}{sinā}{of/about which} is inflected for genitive
case, and stress\index{stress} on the usually unstressed last syllable
suprasegmentally\index{suprasegmental morphology} marks that this form is
contracted from \rayr{sileyen}{sileyena} (\textit{si-ley-ena},
\Rel{}-\PargI{}-\Gen{}).

So far, we have concentrated on suffixes, but there are a number of 
prefixes\index{prefixes} as well; (\ref{ex:letters}) exhibits the past prefix\index{prefixes} 
\rayr{m/}{mə-} (which is actually redundant in this case). There are also 
demonstrative prefixes\index{prefixes} on nouns. In the following example, the prefix\index{prefixes} 
\xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this-} in (\ref{ex:demprefs}) joins the noun
\xayr{pehmF}{peham}{carpet} to indicate a specific carpet.

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:demprefs}%
\begingl
	\gla Le @ no intoyyang eda-peham. //
	\glb le= no int-oy=yang eda=peham-Ø //
	\glc \PatTI{}= want buy-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} this=carpet-\Top{} //
	\glft `I do not want to buy this carpet.' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

Besides prefixes and suffixes, Ayeri also possesses at least one element both
in the verb\index{verbs} cluster and cooccurring with adpositions\index{adpositions} which straddles the
border between inflection and function word. This is the clitic\index{clitics}
marker \rayr{mN}{manga}, which is treated as an independent word in
orthography, but can modify verbs\index{verbs} and adpositions\index{adpositions}---heads of verb phrases (VPs)
and adpositional phrases (PPs), re\-spec\-tive\-ly. It is unstressed and
appears at the margin of its modification target.

% \begin{figure}
\pex
\a\label{ex:prog}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ manga @ yavaya ayon bariley. //
	\glb ang= manga= yava-ya ayon-Ø bari-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{}= \Prog{}= roast-\TsgM{} man-\Top{} meat-\PargI{} //
	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:dyn}\begingl
	\gla Ya @ mətapyyāng maritay misley manga @ luga bari. //
	\glb ya= mə-tapy=yāng maritay mis-ley manga= luga bari-Ø //
	\glc \LocT{}= \Pst{}-put=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} before spit-\PargI{} \Dir{}= 
		between meat-\Top{} //
	\glft `The meat, he had put a spit through it before.' //
\endgl
\xe
% \end{figure}

In (\ref{ex:prog}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the verb \xayr{yv/}{yava-}{roast}
and indicates that this is a temporarily ongoing action, like the English\index{English}
progressive, except not as strongly grammaticalized.\footnote{A
better parallel might be the so-called \fw{rheinische verlaufsform} `Ripuarian
progressive' (\fw{sein} `be' + \fw{am/beim} `at the' + infinitive) in German\index{German}, a
construction common in the colloquial language which parallels the English\index{English}
progressive construction and is not yet fully grammaticalized
\citep[435]{dudengram2016}. Speakers will thus accept both \fw{Er lernt 
gerade}, literally `He studies right now', and \fw{Er ist am lernen} `He is
studying'.
% 
% \ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em]\label{ex:ripprog}\begingl
% 	\gla Der Mann ist Fleisch am Braten. //
% 	\glc the man is meat at.the roasting //
% 	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
% \endgl\xe
}
%
In (\ref{ex:dyn}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the preposition\index{adpositions!prepositions},
to indicate that it is directional: \rayr{lug}{luga} by itself means
`among, between', while its directional form \rayr{mN lug}{manga luga} means
`through; during, for'.

As we have seen in the examples above, person\index{person} suffixes\index{suffixes} on verbs are single 
morphemes that encode more than one property, for example \rayr{/yeNF}{-yeng} 
encodes the person features third person, feminine, singular, and agent. 
Personal pronouns,\index{pronouns!personal} of which the person\index{person} clitics\index{clitics} on 
verbs are an instance, are the main case of fusion among agglutination\index{agglutination} in 
Ayeri, although some of the forms, like \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} above, can 
be decomposed into root and suffix\index{suffixes} without problem.\footnote{Originally, 
Ayeri's personal pronouns\index{pronouns!personal} were indeed agglutinating\index{agglutination} as well, so 
\xayr{yeNF}{yeng}{she} used to be \rayr{Iye\_aNF}{iyeang} (\fw{iy-e-ang}, 
\Tsg{}-\F{}-\Aarg{}). This also gives an explanation to \posscite{boga2016} 
observation that Ayeri's plural pronouns are formed \textcquote[{[}15{]}; 
`possibly in an even too regular way']{boga2016}{[v]ielleicht sogar zu 
regelmäßig}.}

Perpendicular to the axis isolation--agglutination\index{agglutination} runs the axis 
analytic--syn\-thetic\index{synthesis}. On the latter axis, Ayeri scores mostly as 
\emph{synthetic}, since it prefers compactness over spreading a construction 
over several words, though it does not incorporate object\index{grammatical function!primary object} noun phrases (NPs) 
and it is not possible to form `sentence-words' either, so it is not going so 
far as to be poly\-syn\-thetic \citep[45--46]{comrie1989}. It is nonetheless 
theoretically possible, due to suffixation\index{suffixes} being a prominent pattern, to form 
foot-long words like the one in (\ref{ex:footlong}).

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:footlong}\begingl
	\gla da-mətahasongoyyang-ikan //
	\glb da=mə-taha-asa-ong-oy=yang=ikan //
	\glc such=\Pst{}-have-\Hab{}-\Irr{}-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}=much //
	\glft `I would not much used to have had such' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

One case of analytic\index{synthesis} morphology is compound prepositions\index{adpositions!prepositions} like \xayr{mN
lug}{manga luga}{through} in (\ref{ex:dyn}), but verbs\index{verbs} as well show analytic\index{synthesis}
structures not only with the progressive\index{aspect!progressive} marker, but also with modals\index{modals}, as
(\ref{ex:modanalytic}) shows.

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:modanalytic}%
\begingl
	\gla Ming @ sahoyyang dabas. //
	\glb ming= saha-oy=yang dabas //
	\glc can= come-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} today //
	\glft `I can't come today.' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

Most of the information the inflectional phrase\index{phrase types!inflectional phrase} (IP) contains in this example
is marked on the content verb, \xayr{sh/}{saha-}{come}, except for ability,
which is expressed by the modal\index{modals} particle \xayr{miNF}{ming}{can}. \rayr{miNF}{ming} is
an uninflected form of the verb expressing ability and we might count it as an
auxiliary verb in that the full semantic content of the IP\index{phrase types!inflectional phrase} is spread out over
two verb forms, one major, one minor---this probably should not be understood
as a serial verb construction, however
\citep{aikhenvald2006}.\footnote{\rayr{mN}{manga} has, in fact, a verbal
counterpart \xayr{mN/}{manga-}{move; remove} as well, which presumably served
as the origin of both the progressive\index{aspect!progressive} and the directional marker.
\label{fn:mangaverb}} As we will see later (\autoref{subsec:clitics}), though,
these modal particles\index{modals} behave more like clitics\index{clitics} than function words. Consider,
on the other hand, example (\ref{ex:mingfull}), in which \rayr{miNF}{ming} is
inflected like a regular verb.

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:mingfull}
\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya ang @ Diyan. //
	\glb da=ming-ya ang= Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}= Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do it).' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

\section{Morphological processes}

\subsection{Prefixation}
\index{prefixes|(}

Prefixes in Ayeri apply mainly to verbs\index{verbs}, but nouns\index{nouns}, pronouns\index{pronouns}, adjectives\index{adjectives} and
conjunctions as well can appear with them. Some of these are likely clitics\index{clitics};
reasons for their being clitics\index{clitics} will be discussed below in
\autoref{subsec:clitics}. With verbs\index{verbs}, prefixes that are most certainly `true'
prefixes---that is, bound morphemes which have been semantically bleached by
grammaticalization\index{grammaticalization} to the point where they only express grammatical functions
\citep[157\psqq]{lehmann2015}, and which subcategorize for words rather than
phrases \citep[117]{klavans1985}, with a rather high obligation to be marked on
every conjunct in coordination\index{coordination} \citep[139]{spencerluis2012}---are the tense\index{tense}
prefixes marking both three degrees of past and future tense, for example
\rayr{se/}{sə-} in (\ref{ex:tenseprefs}).

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:tenseprefs}
\begingl
	\gla Ang @ səsarāyn ya @ Makapetang. //
	\glb ang= sə-sara=ayn.Ø ya= Makapetang //
	\glc \AgtT{}= \Fut{}-go=\Fpl{}.\Top{} \Loc{}= Makapetang //
	\glft `We will go to Makapetang.' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

Here, the prefix \rayr{se/}{sə-} marks future tense on the verb, 
\xayr{sr/}{sara-}{go}. The other tense\index{tense} prefixes are 
\rayr{k/}{kə-}  (\NPst{}), \rayr{m/}{mə-} (\Pst{}), \rayr{v/}{və-} (\RPst{}),
as well as \rayr{p/}{pa-} (\NFut{}) and \rayr{ni/}{ni-} (\RFut{}). Besides this
set of prefixes, there are also a number of proclitics\index{clitics} that can appear with
verbs, though not exclusively. These are the anaphora \xayr{d/}{da-}{thus, so,
such} and the reflexive\index{pronouns!reflexive} marker
\xayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}{self}, compare (\ref{ex:davb}) and (\ref{ex:sitangvb}).
Furthermore, (\ref{ex:sitangpronvb}) shows that \rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-} can also
be used as a preverbal particle in situations where the agent\index{semantic role!agent} is also the
instrument\index{semantic role!instrument}, so both of the sentences in (\ref{ex:sitangpronvb}) are equivalent in meaning.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[t]{.5\linewidth}
\ex\label{ex:davb}
\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya ang @ Diyan. //
	\glb da=ming-ya ang= Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}= Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (\emph{do it}).' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{minipage}
~
\begin{minipage}[t]{.5\linewidth} 
\ex\label{ex:sitangvb}
\begingl
	\gla Sitang-kecāng. //
	\glb sitang=ket=yāng //
	\glc self=wash=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} //
	\glft `He washes \emph{himself}.' //
\endgl\xe
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

	\glb sa= sitang=apit=yāng nanga ikan //
	\glc \PatT{}= self-clean=\Tsg{}.\Aarg{} house complete //
	\glft (\fw{idem}) //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

\phantomsection\label{nounprefixes}
Example (\ref{ex:sitang+pronoun}) shows the more common application of 
\rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}, that is, as a reflexive modifier of pronouns\index{pronouns!reflexive}. Moreover,
the prefix \rayr{d/}{da-} can be used with NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase} and is part of
the demonstrative set of prefixes (which behave, in fact, like proclitics\index{clitics}),
\xayr{d/}{da-}{such}, \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, and \xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that} as shown in (\ref{ex:dempfxs}).

\begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:dempfxs}\begingl
	\gla eda- / ada- / da-ganang //
	\glb eda= / ada= / da=gan-ang //
	\glc this= / that= / such.a=child-\Aarg{} //
	\glft `this/that/such a child' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

The demonstrative prefixes are also used to form the demonstrative 
pronouns\index{pronouns!demonstrative} \xayr{EdnY}{edanya}{this one}, 
\xayr{AdnY}{adanya}{that one} and \xayr{dnY}{danya}{(such) one}. A special case
in this regard is the postposition\index{adpositions!postpositions} \xayr{d/naarY}{da-nārya}{in spite of,
despite} where \rayr{d/}{da-} combines with the conjunction
\xayr{naarY}{nārya}{but, although, except}. Originally, 
\xayr{dikpis}{dikapisa}{respective} is derived from \rayr{d/}{da-} + 
\xayr{Ikpis}{ikapisa}{bound, dependent}, which is an example of combination 
with an adjective\index{adjectives}. There is also a fixed adverbial expression using one of
these prefixes, \xayr{Ed/tdjymF}{eda-tadayyam}{for the time being, for now}
(this=time-\Dat{}). Last but not least, the prefix \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as
though} (also a proclitic\index{clitics}) can be used with both adjectives\index{adjectives} and nouns\index{nouns}, as well
as complement clauses\index{complement clause}, as shown in (\ref{ex:kucombin}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:kucombin}
\a\begingl
	\gla ku-koyaya //
	\glb ku=koya-ya //
	\glc like=book-\Loc{} //
	\glft `like in a book' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla ku-prasi //
	\glb ku=prasi //
	\glc like=sour //
	\glft `as though (it were) sour' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla ku-adareng turavangas //
	\glb ku=ada-reng turavang-as //
	\glc like=that-\AargI{} problem-\Parg{} //
	\glft `as though that were a problem' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

An example of a set-phrase adverbial consisting of \rayr{ku/}{ku-} and a verb 
is \xayr{ku/nsY}{ku-nasya}{as follows}, \rayr{nsY/}{nasy-} meaning `follow'. 
What is curious here is that this fossilized form is lacking person marking 
and is just extended with an epenthetic \textit{-a} since \textit{-sy} is not 
a permissible coda. The expected form would be 
*\rayr{ku/nsYreNF}{*ku-nasyareng} (like-follow=\TsgI{}.\Aarg{}).

Following \citet{klavans1985}, who suggests that clitics\index{clitics} best be defined as
\textcquote[117]{klavans1985}{affixation at the phrasal level}, a very common
kind of prefix to the inflectional \emph{phrase} are the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} markers. They
are counted as parts of the IP\index{phrase types!inflectional phrase} but they do not interact with it regarding stress\index{stress}
assignment: topic\index{grammatical function!topic} particles are always unstressed\index{stress}. Besides this, they are consistently
placed in clause-initial position, preceding\index{word order} any other preverbal elements. 
Earlier examples have already included topic particles, but a dedicated example of their
placement is given again here, in (\ref{ex:topclt}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:topclt}
	\a\begingl
		\gla Ang @ tahanya tamanley. //
		\glb ang= tahan-ya taman-ley //
		\glc \AgtT{}= write-\TsgM{} letter-\PargI{} //
		\glft `He writes a letter.' //
	\endgl
	\a \textit{Ang mətahanya tamanley.} `He wrote a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga mətahanya tamanley.} `He was writing a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga no mətahanya tamanley.} `He was wanting to write a 
		letter.'
\xe
\end{figure}

The word \xayr{kudpluNF}{kudapalung}{other than that, apart from that} is an
interesting case in that it is a fossilized form of multiple proclitics\index{clitics} being
stacked on an adjective\index{adjectives}. \rayr{kudpluNF}{kudapalung} is transparently made up
of the root \xayr{pluNF}{palung}{other, different} to which are added
\xayr{d/}{da-}{so, such} and \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as though}.

\index{prefixes|)}

\subsection{Suffixation}
\index{suffixes|(}

As a largely agglutinating language, most grammatical marking in Ayeri is done by 
suffixes. These occur mainly with nouns and verbs,
however, some basic quantifiers and intensifiers take the shape of suffixes as well, but behave
more like enclitics. Quantifiers and intensifiers may modify content words almost regardless of
their part of speech---noun, verb, adjective, adverb, or adposition. The most pervasive
examples of suffixation are certainly those of case marking on nouns and of
person marking on verbs, as exemplified in (\ref{ex:conjdecl}).

% \begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:conjdecl}\begingl
	\gla Sa @ pəharuyang va manga @ miday tangya vana suyareri, vimyon! //
	\glb sa= pə-haru=yang va.Ø manga= miday tang-ya vana suyar-eri vimyon //
	\glc \PatT{}= \NFut{}-beat=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} \Ssg{}.\Top{} \Dir{}= around 
		ears-\Loc{} \Ssg{}.\Gen{} ladle-\Ins{} monkey //
	\glft `I'll beat you around your ears with a ladle, you monkey!' //
\endgl\xe
% \end{figure}

This example shows marking of \xayr{tNF}{tang}{ears} with the locative case
suffix \rayr{/y}{-ya} and the marking of \xayr{suyrF}{suyar}{ladle} with the
instrumental case suffix \rayr{/Eri}{-eri}; the previous examples already
provide instances of the exceedingly common markers for agent and patient case,
\rayr{/ANF}{-ang} and \rayr{/AsF}{-as}, respectively. Besides case\index{case}, nouns\index{nouns} can
be marked for plural\index{number!plural} with the suffix \rayr{/ye}{-ye}, and verb\index{verbs} roots may
be extended by the mood\index{mood} and aspect\index{aspect} markers \rayr{/ONF}{-ong} (\Irr{}),
\rayr{/As}{-asa} (\Hab{}) and \rayr{/Oj}{-oy} (\Neg{}), the last of which is 
the most frequently occurring one. The mood\index{mood} suffixes can also be stacked,
leading to the long word in (\ref{ex:footlong}) above. Person marking on verbs\index{verbs}
is realized as an agreement\index{agreement} suffix or as a clitic\index{clitics} personal pronoun\index{pronouns!personal} depending on
whether an agent NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} proper is present or not for the verb\index{verbs} to agree\index{agreement} with. In
(\ref{ex:conjdecl}), a cliticized agent pronoun \xayr{/yNF}{-yang}{I}
(\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}) appears.

As mentioned above, both quantifiers\index{quantifiers} and intensifiers may appear as enclitics\index{clitics} on almost any type of
content word, like \xayr{/m}{-ma}{enough} on the adverb \xayr{pr}{para}{fast} in (\ref{ex:advclts}),
for instance.

\subsection{Reduplication}
\label{subsec:reduplication}
\index{reduplication|(}

There are two patterns of reduplication for verbs\index{verbs}, one with complete
reduplication of the imperative form, which serves to create a hortative statement
(\ref{ex:hort}), and one with partial reduplication as a way to express that an
action takes place again. That is, partial reduplication expresses an
iterative, compare (\ref{ex:iter}). The imperative iterative, then, has a
hortative function as well in (\ref{ex:hort+iter}).

\begin{figure}
\pex
\a\label{ex:hort}\begingl%
	\gla naru-naru //
	\glb naru\til{}nara-u //
	\glc \Hort{}\til{}speak-\Imp{} //

\endgl

\a\label{ex:iter}\begingl
	\gla na-narayeng //
	\glb na\til{}nara=yeng //
	\glc \Iter{}\til{}speak=\TsgF{}.\Aarg{} //
	\glft `she speaks again' //
\endgl

	\glb na\til{}nara-u //
	\glc \Iter{}\til{}speak-\Imp{} //
	\glft `let's speak again' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

With nouns\index{nouns}, full reduplication is used to create a diminutive\index{diminutive}
form in (\ref{ex:regdim}), though some reduplications are also lexicalized and
may use roots from other parts of speech as well to form nouns\index{nouns}, for instance,
the words in (\ref{ex:otherredupnn}--\hyperref[ex:otherredupvb]{d}). There are
also a number of adjectives\index{adjectives} for which there exists a lexical reduplication with
an intensifying meaning; (\ref{ex:adjredup}) lists a few examples. This,
however, is not a productive derivation\index{derivation} strategy.

\begin{figure}

\index{suprasegmental morphology|(}

\index{morphophonology}
As written above (\autoref{doublerel}), case\index{case} agreement\index{agreement} on a complex-marked
relative pronoun\index{pronouns!relative} can drop out under certain
circumstances and is replaced by compensatory stress\index{stress} on the secondary case\index{case}
marker, which lengthens the syllable's nucleus vowel\index{vowels}, compare
(\ref{ex:relpromorphphon}).

\begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:relpromorphphon}
\begingl
	\gla \dots tamanley sinā \textup{(}*sina\textup{)} ang @ ningay tamala

		tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday \Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `\dots the letter which (*whose) I told you about yesterday' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

This morphophonemic process can be reinterpreted so that vowel\index{vowels} length/stress\index{stress} itself is what signifies
the agreement\index{agreement} of the relativizer\index{pronouns!relative} with its antecedent. Which grammatical role
the relativizer's\index{pronouns!relative} antecedent represents is
underspecified in this case. Hence, I will gloss it as `-\Agr{}' in the following example
instead of as full `-\PargI{}'. This is illustrated in (\ref{ex:relprostress}).
Since \rayr{n}{na}, as a light syllable, cannot be stressed\index{stress} in word-final
position under normal circumstances, it has to lengthen to \rayr{naa}{nā}.

\subsection{Clitics}
\label{subsec:clitics}
\index{clitics|(}

I have been using the term `clitic' above and claimed that the one or the other
morpheme in Ayeri is a clitic. Clitics, however, cannot easily be defined in a
formal way, as it appears \citep[126]{spencerluis2012}. Based on
\citet{spencerluis2012}, with recourse to \citet{zwickypullum1983}, some
important, typical characteristics of clitics are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Clitics behave in part like function words and in part like affixes, 
		but in any case, they are not free morphemes 
		\citep[38, 42]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Clitics tend to be phonologically weak items 
		\citep[39]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Clitics prominently---and importantly---tend to attach 
		`promiscuously' to surrounding words. That is, unlike inflection, they 
		are not limited to connect to a certain part of speech or to align 
		with their host in semantics \citep[40, 108–109]{spencerluis2012}.
	% \item Clitics tend to appear in a second position, whether that is after
	% 	a word, or an intonational or syntactic phrase
	% 	\citep[41]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Clitics tend to be templatic and to cluster, especially if they 
		encode inflection-like information \citep[41, 47--48]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Clitics have none of the freedom of ordering found in independent 
		words and phrases \citep[43]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Positions of `special' clitics tend to not be available to free 
		words \citep[44]{spencerluis2012}.
	% \item Clitics tend to be functional morphemes, and to realize a single 
	% 	morphosyntactic property \citep[67, 179]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item There are no paradigmatic gaps \citep[108--109]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item There tends to be no morphophonemic alteration like vowel harmony, 
		stress shift or sandhi between a clitic and its host 
		\citep[108--109]{spencerluis2012}.
	% \item There tends to be no idiosyncratic change in meaning when a clitic 
	% 	and a clitic host come together, unlike there may be with inflection 
	% 	\citep[108, 110]{spencerluis2012}.
	\item Similar to affixes, clitics and their host tend to be treated as a 
		syntactic unit, that is, lexical integrity prevents that word material
		can be put in between a clitic and its host 
		\citep[108, 110]{spencerluis2012}.
	% \item Clitics usually get joined to a host word after inflection 
	% 	\citep[108, 110]{spencerluis2012}.
	% \item Affixes tend to go on every word in a conjunct (narrow scope),
	% 	while clitics have a tendency to treat a conjunct as a unit to attach
	% 	to (wide scope; \cite[139, 196\psqq]{spencerluis2012}).
\end{itemize}

However, \citet{spencerluis2012} point out many counterexamples to the points
on this list in order to highlight that the border between clitics and affixes
is often fuzzy. Given this fuzziness, it comes as no surprise that, according to
their assessment, there is a lot of miscategorization in individual grammars as
a result \citep[107]{spencerluis2012}. Another consequence of this lack of a
clear delineation between clitics and affixes is that, since not all of the
traits described above are always present, making a checklist and summing up
the tally is only of limited value. The traits listed above are thus sufficient
conditions only, not necessary ones. In the following, I want to elaborate on
the classification of various prefixes, suffixes, and particles as
clitics.\footnote{The following discussion incorporates most of the content of
a blog article I previously wrote on this topic, \citet{benung:clitics}, with
some additions and corrections. Since clitics sit at the junction of morphology
and syntax, it will be necessary at times to deal with topics roughly which
will be elaborated on in \autoref{ch:phrasestruct} in more detail.}

\subsubsection{Preposed particles and prefixes}

\label{clitics_preverb} The preverbal particles should be rather unproblematic 
with regards to their classification as clitics, that is,
the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} marker, one or several modal
particles\index{modals}, the progressive marker\index{aspect!progressive}, and
also the emphatic affirmative and negative discourse particles\index{discourse
particles}. All of these particles essentially have functional rather than
lexical content, and are usually unstressed\index{stress}. They come in a cluster with a fixed
order\index{word order}, and they appear in a position where no ordinary word material could go,
since Ayeri is strictly verb-initial.\footnote{The translation of
`\citetitle{shelley:ozymandias}' in \autoref{sec:ozymandias} deviates from this
rule in \ayr{nmaaNF }\ayr{smF }\ayr{kaarYo }\ayr{nj }\ayr{trYnFkj }
\ayr{beNYonF }\ayr{AdaahlY} \fw{namāng sam kāryo nay taryankay bengyon
adāhalya.} `Two big and torsoless legs stand in that desert' by having the
subject NP \xayr{nmaaNF smF —}{namāng sam \dots}{two legs \dots} precede the verb
\xayr{beNYonF}{bengyon}{(they) stand}. This is non-standard syntax in a poetic
text.} In conjuncts it is also unnecessary to mark every verb with one or
several preverbal particles, as we see in (\ref{ex:clitics_1}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_1}
\a\label{ex:clitics_1a}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ kece nay dayungisaye māva yanjas yena. //
	\glb ang= ket-ye nay dayungisa-ye māva-Ø yan-ye-as yena //
	\glc \AgtT{}= wash-\TsgF{} and dress-\TsgF{} mother-\Top{}
		boy-\Pl{}-\Parg{} \TsgF{}.\Gen{} //
	\glft `The mother washes and dresses her boys.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:clitics_1b}\begingl
	\gla Manga @ sahaya rangya nay nedraya ang @ Tikim. //
	\glb manga= saha-ya rang-ya nay nedra-ya ang= Tikim //
	\glc \Prog{}= come-\TsgM{} home-\Loc{} and sit-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}= Tikim //
	\glft `Tikim is coming home and sitting down.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:clitics_1c}\begingl

		\Iter{}\til{}sell=\TsgM{}.\Top{} toy-\Pl{}-\PargI{} //
	\glft `He should be able to repair and resell the toys.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

\label{clitics_preverb_top}
In (\ref{ex:clitics_1a}), therefore, the agent-topic\index{grammatical function!topic} 
marker \rayr{ANF}{ang} only occurs before \xayr{ketYe}{kece}{(she) washes}, and
the conjoined verb \xayr{dyuNisye}{dayungisaye}{(she) dresses} is also within
its scope. Repeating the marker as well before the latter verb could either be
considered ungrammatical because there is only one topic
there---\xayr{maav}{māva} {mother}---or the sentence could be interpreted as
having two conjoined clauses with different subjects: `[She washes] and [mother
dresses] her boys.' The latter outcome has \rayr{maav}{māva} as the topic only
of \rayr{dyuNisye}{dayungisaye}, while \rayr{ketYe}{kece}'s topic is the person
marking on the verb---a pro-drop subject\index{grammatical function!subject}, essentially.\footnote{This claim is
further investigated below, p.~\pageref{subsubsec:suffixes}\,ff.; also compare
\autoref{subsec:persnumagr}.}

\label{clitics_preverb_prog}
In (\ref{ex:clitics_1b}), then, the progressive\index{aspect!progressive} marker 
\rayr{mN}{manga} likewise has scope\index{scope} over both verb\index{verbs} conjuncts,
\xayr{shy}{sahaya}{(he) comes} and \xayr{nedFry}{nedraya}{(he) sits} in what is
a case of extended/distributed exponence. This is to say that
functionally contiguous information can sometimes be split over several words,
so that the functional annotation of each verb\index{verbs} in (\ref{ex:clitics_1b}) can be
represented in the fashion of the (incomplete) f-structure matrix
\parencites[see][]{bresnan2016}{buttking2015} shown in (\ref{ex:clitics_2}),
which is an attempt to represent the phrase \xayr{ANF mN sh/}{ang manga
saha-}{is coming} formally. \rayr{mN}{manga} is treated there as being part of
things the verb\index{verbs} inflects for, that is, progressive aspect\index{aspect!progressive}, in spite of
appearing superficially as a function word. The topic\index{grammatical function!topic} marker \rayr{ANF}{ang}
does not reflect a morphological property of the verb\index{verbs} in the way the
progressive\index{aspect!progressive} marker does, but announces the case\index{case} and---for agents\index{case!agent} and
patients\index{case!patient}---the animacy\index{animacy} value of the topicalized\index{grammatical function!topic} NP, so the
f-structure in (\ref{ex:clitics_2}) lists this information under the \Top{}
function.\footnote{In the chart, angular brackets group grammatical functions.
Since the verb\index{verbs} is the head of the clause, the first \Pred{} (predicator) lists
the verb\index{verbs} with its argument structure (a-structure). In the case of
(\ref{ex:clitics_2}), \Subj{} and \Oblq{loc} indicate that `come', governs two
arguments: a subject\index{grammatical function!subject} and an oblique\index{grammatical function!oblique} argument in the form of a location
adverbial\index{grammatical function!oblique}. These have been omitted for brevity.}

\end{avm}

\label{clitics_preverb_modal}
Modal particles\index{modals}, exemplified in (\ref{ex:clitics_1c}), are
probably slightly less typical as clitics since it seems feasible for them to
be stressed\index{stress} for contrast. What is not possible, however, is to front either
\xayr{mY}{mya}{be supposed to} or \xayr{miNF}{ming}{can}, and the verb\index{verbs} itself
also cannot precede\index{word order} the particles, which is demonstrated in
(\ref{ex:clitics_3}). It is also not possible to coordinate\index{coordination} any of the elements
in the preverbal particle cluster with \xayr{nj}{nay}{and}, as shown in
(\ref{ex:clitics_4}).

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Unlike verbs, modal particles\index{modals} in Ayeri resist
inflection, so in (\ref{ex:clitics_1c}) the irrealis\index{mood!irrealis} suffix\index{suffixes} \rayr{/ONF}{-ong}
is realized on the verb \xayr{sidegoNY}{sidegongya}{(he) would repair} instead
of on one or both of the modal particles\index{modals} as *\rayr{miNONF}{*mingong} and
*\rayr{mYONF}{*myong}, respectively. The combination of \xayr{mY}{mya}{be
supposed to} with an irrealis-marked\index{mood!irrealis} verb together indicates that the speaker
thinks the action denoted by the verb \emph{should} be carried out. The marking
on the verb\index{verbs} may then be interpreted as being functionally shared by the
constituent parts of the whole verb complex. The same goes for negation\index{negation}: only
the verb\index{verbs} can be negated\index{mood!negative}, but not the modal particle\index{modals}. Possibly, it would be
useful in this case to abstract the modal particles\index{modals} as a feature
\Mod{}\textsc{ality} as listed by \citet[Feature Table]{pargram} for purposes
of functional representation. At least superficially, it looks as though Ayeri
acts different from English\index{English} here in that the content verb\index{verbs} is not a complement\index{grammatical function!open complement}
of the modal element. This assumption is supported by the fact that in Ayeri,
the verb\index{verbs} inflects, but not the modal particle\index{modals}. Furthermore, modal particles\index{modals}
cannot be modified by adverbs\index{adverbs} in the way regular verbs\index{verbs} can, see
(\ref{ex:clitics_5}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_5}

\end{figure}

Combinations of topic\index{grammatical function!topic} particle and modal particle\index{modals}, as well as modal particle\index{modals}
and verb\index{verbs}, likewise cannot be interrupted by parenthetical material like
\xayr{nrtNF}{naratang}{they say}, which we can see in the pattern emerging in
(\ref{ex:clitics_6}).

\label{clitics_prenoun_case}
Besides verbs, nouns\index{nouns} as well have preposed modifiers\index{word order}. This is the
case with proper nouns\index{nouns!proper} specifically, where the name is preceded\index{word order} by a case\index{case}
particle instead of receiving a case-marking suffix\index{suffixes} like common nouns\index{nouns} do. This
case\index{case} marker is phonologically weak in that its phonological make-up is similar
to that of affixes, and unstressed\index{stress}, with the exception of the causative case\index{case!causative}
marker \rayr{saa}{sā}, which bears at least secondary stress\index{stress} since it contains
a long vowel. We already saw case\index{case} particles preceding\index{word order} names in
(\ref{ex:clitics_1b}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_5}) above: \rayr{ANF tikimF}{ang
Tikim} and \rayr{ANF diy}{ang Diya}; \rayr{ANF}{ang} marks the proper-noun NPs
as agents in both cases. The case\index{case} marker is missing when the NP is topicalized,\index{grammatical function!topic}
as indicated in (\ref{ex:clitics_6}), where the agent NP appears as just
\rayr{diy}{Diya}, not \rayr{ANF diy}{ang Diya}. While case\index{case} suffixes\index{suffixes} have narrow
scope\index{scope} as shown in (\ref{ex:clitics_7a}) and thus need to be repeated on every
NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} in a conjunct, preposed\index{word order} case\index{case} markers as that in (\ref{ex:clitics_7c}) may be
used with wide scope\index{scope} if both conjuncts are proper nouns\index{nouns!proper}. Narrow scope\index{scope} with
proper nouns may add an individuating connotation, exemplified by
(\ref{ex:clitics_7d}).

% [The blog article here first postulates that the case markers might attach
% phonologically to whatever precedes them, which would make them very
% clitic-like in not being `choosy' about attachment only to find that this
% does not make sense. We will thus skip this unnecessary information as well
% as a bunch of examples.]

Taking the above characteristics into account---inability to insert word
material, special positioning, and wide scope\index{scope}---one may argue that the preposed\index{word order}
case\index{case} markers are clitics. It should be noted furthermore that a single NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}
cannot be marked for two grammatical functions at the same time, so that case\index{case}
markers cannot be coordinated\index{coordination}, as is attempted in (\ref{ex:precasecoord}) below
with *\rayr{s nj ːs sopnF}{*sa nay sā Sopan}.

\begin{figure}

	\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

The case\index{case} markers of proper nouns\index{nouns!proper} are necessarily proclitics rather than
enclitics to preceding word material, since it is possible for them to begin
utterances, where it is not possible to lean to the left, but only to the 
right. This is the case in equative sentences such as the one in 
(\ref{ex:clitics_11a}). In these cases as well, it is not possible for
parenthetical material to be placed between the case\index{case} marker and its target of
modification, as in (\ref{ex:clitics_11b}); the particle and its head cohere
closely and behave essentially like a unit.

The fact that case\index{case} particles attach always to a proper noun\index{nouns!proper} very specifically
makes them unlike `typical' clitics, since according to
\citet{spencerluis2012}, a typical and important feature of clitics is their
`promiscuous' attachment, as described initially. This puts case\index{case} particles
closer to affixes---just like the suffixed\index{suffixes} case\index{case} markers. On the other hand, as
previously pointed out, clitics do not have to exhibit all traits often
associated with them in order to be counted as such. Yet more typical of
function words, on the other hand, is the fact that there is no morphophonemic
interaction between a case\index{case} particle and the word it modifies. Thus, for
instance, there is no form /saːʤaːn/ resulting from the combination of
\rayr{s}{sa} (\Parg{}) with \rayr{AgYaanF}{Ajān}. This overlap in form between
affix and function word is typical of clitics, according to the traits
excerpted from \citet{spencerluis2012} above.

\label{clitics_prep_dyn}
As discussed previously, \rayr{mN}{manga} may not only modify verbs, but also
ad\-posi\-tions---which in the case of prepositions\index{adpositions!prepositions} are often very
transparently derived\index{derivation} from nouns\index{nouns}. \rayr{mN}{manga} in combination with an
adposition\index{adpositions} indicates that there is motion into the
specified direction. The directional marker \rayr{mN}{manga} is thus a
functional morpheme and it always appears before\index{word order} the adposition\index{adpositions} itself.
Adpositions do not otherwise inflect, but \rayr{mN}{manga}, due to its
functional nature, could reasonably be construed as inflection, in spite of
appearing as a function word, just as its (related) verbal counterpart. This
double nature makes it a good candidate for a clitic. Applying a shuffling or
coordination\index{coordination} test here to figure out whether \rayr{mN}{manga} is an adjuct is
moot, since there is nothing else which can appear in this position---the
position \rayr{mN}{manga} appears in is thus syntactically privileged;
\rayr{mN}{manga} can be said to exhibit special syntax, which is further
evidence for it being a clitic. With regards to the distinction between special
and simple clitics \citep{zwicky1977}, it ought to be classified as the former,
since even though it may be derived\index{derivation} from the verb \xayr{mN/}{manga}{move}, this
verb does not constitute the particle's associated full form:

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_manga}
\a\label{ex:clitics_manga1}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ saraya Ajān manga @ kong nangaya. //
	\glb ang= sara-ya Ajān manga= kong nanga-ya //
	\glc \AgtT{} go-\TsgM{} Ajān \Dir{}= inside house-\Loc{} //
	\glft `Ajān goes into the house.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:clitics_manga2}\ljudge{\excl}\begingl

	\glft `Ajān goes to move inside the house.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

Example (\ref{ex:clitics_manga2}) assumes that the hypothetical correct place
of the verb \xayr{mN/}{manga-}{move} to appear in is as an infinite complement
of the main verb in the sentence, \xayr{sr/}{sara-}{go}. While not
ungrammatical \fw{per se}, the sentence would imply that \rayr{AgYaanF}{Ajān}
walks away in order to move around in the house, which is not what
(\ref{ex:clitics_manga1}) posits. There is thus no direct semantic relationship
between what we assumed to be the historical full form and the grammatical
marker, that is, the full verb and the directional particle cannot be used
interchangeably. When testing with parenthetical word material, it becomes
clear that \xayr{mN koNF}{manga kong}{into} forms a syntactic unit, which is
demonstrated in (\ref{ex:clitics_mangacohesion}). \rayr{mN}{manga} is a bound
morpheme, and thus not a function word proper.

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_mangacohesion}
\a\label{ex:clitics_mangacohesion1}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ saraya Ajān, \textbf{narayāng}, manga @ kong nangaya. //

\end{figure}

Also, when testing \rayr{mN}{manga}'s behavior in terms of distribution over
coordinated\index{coordination} NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, we can see in (\ref{ex:clitics_mangacoord2}) that there is no
problem in condensing the sentence given in (\ref{ex:clitics_mangacoord1}) to
the extent that \rayr{mN}{manga} governs two adpositions\index{adpositions} in
coordination\index{coordination}---\xayr{midj}{miday}{around} and
\xayr{koNF}{kong}{inside}---sharing the same adpositional object,
\xayr{nN}{nanga}{house}.

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_mangacoord}
\a\label{ex:clitics_mangacoord1}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ saraya {} @ Ajān manga @ miday nangaya nay manga @ kong

		house-\Loc{} //
	\glft `Ajān goes around and into the house.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

For all intents and purposes, thus, \rayr{mN}{manga} behaves syntactically like
a typical clitic in that it has wide scope\index{scope} over conjuncts, coheres tightly with
its target of modification, is located in a syntactically privileged position,
and unites properties of both function words and inflection.

\label{clitics_preverb_da}
From this discussion of prenominal particles (and a pre-adpositional one), let us
return to verbs again for a moment. Besides the preverbal particles discussed
above, there is also what is spelled as a prefix\index{prefixes} on the verb\index{verbs} which appears to
be a little odd as such in that it can have wide scope\index{scope} over conjoined verbs\index{verbs}.
This is the prefix\index{prefixes} \rayr{d/} {da-} often meaning `so, thus', displayed in
(\ref{ex:clitics_13}).

\begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:clitics_13}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ da-pinyaya nay hisaya {} @ Yan sa @ Pila. //
	\glb ang= da=pinya-ya nay hisa-ya Ø= Yan sa= Pila //
	\glc \AgtT{}= so=ask-\TsgM{} and beg-\TsgM{} \Top{}= Yan \Parg{}= Pila //
	\glft `Yan asks and begs Pila to (do so).' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

\rayr{d/}{da-}, where it is not used for presentative 
purposes,\footnote{Although this use is probably related to the anaphoric use.}
is a functional morpheme in that it basically acts as an anaphora for a
complementizer phrase\index{phrase types!complementizer phrase} (CP) the speaker chooses to drop. Thus, it does not mark
any of the intrinsic morphological categories of the verb (tense, aspect, mood,
modality, finiteness), just as the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} marker marks for none of the verb's
own categories of inflection, but instead refers to a grammatical function the
verb subcategorizes for. As an anaphora, \rayr{d/}{da-} cannot stand alone,
though it is possible to use a full demonstrative form \xayr{dnY}{danya}{such
one} in its place, compare (\ref{ex:clitics_14}).

\begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:clitics_14}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ pinyaya nay hisaya {} @ Yan sa @ Pila danyaley. //
	\glb ang= pinya-ya nay hisa-ya Ø= Yan sa= Pila danya-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{}= ask-\TsgM{} and beg-\TsgM{} \Top{}= Yan \Parg{}= Pila
		such.one-\PargI{} //
	\glft `Yan asks and begs Pila such.' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

Unlike the preverbal particles, \rayr{d/}{da-} can be associated with a full
form, though it still displays special syntax. Unlike English\index{English}
\fw{-n't} or \fw{'ll}, for instance, it does not occur in the same place as
the full form. Note also how \rayr{d/}{da-} is appended to the right of tense\index{tense}
prefixes\index{prefixes}, which \emph{do} express a property of the verb, as shown in 
(\ref{ex:clitics_15}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_15}
\a\label{ex:clitics_15a}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ da-məpinyaya sa @ Pila. //
	\glb ang= da=mə-pinya=ya.Ø sa= Pila //
	\glc \AgtT{}= so=\Pst{}=ask=\TsgM{}.\Top{} \Parg{}= Pila //
	\glft `He asked Pila to.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:clitics_15b}\begingl

	\glb ang= da=mə-pinya-ya nay mə-hisa-ya Ø= Yan sa= Pila //

		\Parg{}= Pila //
	\glft `Yan asked and begged Pila to.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

The verb form in (\ref{ex:clitics_15}) becomes ungrammatical with the order of
its prefixes\index{prefixes} reversed, so \rayr{md/pinYy}{məda-pinyaya} is not acceptable.
Note, though, that pre-\index{prefixes} and suffixes\index{suffixes} proper also have a fixed order\index{affix order} in Ayeri,
so this alone is probably not enough evidence to claim that \rayr{d/}{da-} is
not possibly a prefix\index{prefixes}. Furthermore, while the tense\index{tense} prefixes\index{prefixes} undergo crasis,
this is not the case with \rayr{d/}{da-}, as (\ref{ex:clitics_16}) shows.

\begin{figure}

The \rayr{d/}{da-} prefix\index{prefixes} satisfies the criteria of being a
phonologically reduced form of an otherwise free functional morpheme, and of
occurring in a place where normal syntax would not put the full form. It has
wide scope\index{scope} over conjuncts, is attached outside of inflection for
proper categories of the verb, and doesn't interact with its host with regards
to morphophonemics. In addition to these more typical traits of clitics, there
is also no way in (\ref{ex:clitics_18}) to place words between \rayr{d/}{da-}
and the verb stem.

% \begin{figure}

\label{clitics_preverb_refl}
The prefix\index{prefixes} \xayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}{self} behaves in the same way as \rayr{d/}
{da-}, since it also abbreviates a reflexive determiner phrase (DP), for instance,
\xayr{sitNF/yesF}{sitang-yes}{herself} where `herself', as a patient\index{semantic role!patient}, is
coreferential with the agent\index{semantic role!agent} of the clause. One might assume that reflexivity
is a verbal category of inflection in Ayeri, although, on the other hand, Ayeri
also does not have\index{typology} any verbs which appear as grammatically reflexive to
indicate unaccusativity like in Romance languages. The reflexive\index{pronouns!reflexive} marking in
Ayeri is thus semantically motivated, not functionally.

\label{clitics_prenoun_dem}
Ayeri has a tendency to reuse prefixes\index{prefixes} with different parts of speech, and thus
\rayr{d/}{da-} is also used with nouns\index{nouns}, forming part of the series of deictic\index{deixis}
prefixes\index{prefixes}, \xayr{d/}{da-}{such (a)}, \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this},
\xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}. The prefix\index{prefixes} in all these cases represents a grammatical
function, is unstressed\index{stress}, and may have wide scope\index{scope} over conjoined NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, unless an
individuating interpretation is intended, as in (\ref{ex:clitics_21b}). These
traits are typical of clitics, as we have seen, though (\ref{ex:clitics_22})
shows that unlike with verbs, the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes} do undergo crasis, which is
a trait more typically associated with affixes.

\begin{figure}

	\glft `This man, we can help him.' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

The deictic prefixes\index{prefixes} also cannot be used with all types of NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, only with those
headed by common and proper nouns\index{nouns}; the picky nature of the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes}
also makes them more typical of affixes than of clitics. The preverbal
particles, on the other hand, also only occur with verbs, and it was
nonetheless argued for them to be classified as clitics above due to the
presence of other traits which make the particle under scrutiny clitic-like.

As mentioned initially, \citet{spencerluis2012} give numerous counterexamples
to the catalog of traits typically associated with clitics. One of these
counterexamples is what they call `suspended affixation'. This phenomenon
occurs in Turkish\index{Turkish}, for instance, where the plural suffix \fw{-lEr} and
subsequent suffixes can be left out in coordination (\ref{ex:clitics_23a}), as
well as case markers (\ref{ex:clitics_23b}), and adverbials with case-like
functions (\ref{ex:clitics_23c}).

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\citet{spencerluis2012} note that in \textquote{the nominal domain especially,
wide scope inflection is widespread in the languages of Eurasia, becoming more
prominent from west to east}, and that wide scope affixation \textcquote[200]
{spencerluis2012}{can be found with inflectional and derivational morphology in
a number of languages, and it is often a symptom of recent and not quite
complete morphologization}. They report further that \citet{wälchli2005} finds
that suspended affixation is especially common with `natural coordination',
that is, the combination of items very frequently occurring in pairs like
\fw{knife and fork} or \fw{mother and father}, as opposed to cases of
occasional coordination \citep[200]{spencerluis2012}. Whether this is also true
for Ayeri as of now would require a separate survey\index{desiderata}.\footnote{Or rather,
devising supplemental rules.} Ayeri is not (intended to be) of Eurasian stock,
though since there is evidence of this phenomenon, it should at least be
considered.

Given the evidence from Turkish\index{Turkish}, the categorization of deictic prefixes\index{prefixes} as
\emph{either} affixes \emph{or} clitics is unclear, especially since the
diagnostic of scope\index{scope} is devalued by the Turkish\index{Turkish} examples. On the other hand,
suffixes\index{suffixes} on nouns\index{nouns} do not behave this way in Ayeri, as demonstrated in
(\ref{ex:clitics_24})---they rather behave like typical affixes in that they
mandatorily occur on each conjunct. The question is, thus, whether an exception
should be made for prefixes\index{prefixes} on nouns. We may as well assume that they are
clitics.

From a functional point of view, the exact nature of the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes}
should not matter either way---\citet[Feature Table]{pargram} also cites a
\Deix{}\textsc{is} feature with \Prox{}\textsc{imal} and \Dist{}\textsc{al}
as its values, which fits \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this} and \xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}
just fine. At present it is unclear,\index{desiderata} however, how to represent `such (a)' in
this respect, since it is clearly deictic\index{deixis}, but neither  proximal nor distal. In
this case, it should be possible to use \ups{\Deix{}}~=~\{$this$, $that$, $such$\} as well,
hence:

\pex\label{ex:clitics_25}
\a\label{ex:clitics_25a}\begingl
	\gla edāyon //

As described above, proper nouns\index{nouns!proper} are case-marked by clitic case\index{case} markers
preceding\index{word order} the noun. In fact, these markers must be located somewhere at the
left periphery of the NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, so the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes} stand in between the case\index{case}
marker and the proper noun\index{nouns!proper} itself. This is unproblematic for lexical
integrity, since the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes} are not free morphemes. And even if they
were part of inflection, the case\index{case} markers, as clitics, would be on the 
outside---the order\index{word order} \textsc{deictic prefix}--\textsc{case marker}--%
\textsc{noun} is ungrammatical. An example of this is given in 
(\ref{ex:clitics_26}).

The question now is, what happens to coordinated\index{coordination} proper nouns\index{nouns!proper}? Since the
suffixed\index{suffixes} case\index{case} markers on common nouns have the distributional properties of
affixes, they occur on every conjunct. The deictic prefixes\index{prefixes}, however, only
occur on the first, unless an individuating reading is intended, as shown in
(\ref{ex:clitics_20}). For proper nouns\index{nouns!proper} it ought to be possible for both a case\index{case}
marker and a deictic prefix\index{prefixes} to have scope\index{scope} over coordinated\index{coordination} proper nouns\index{nouns!proper}, as in
(\ref{ex:clitics_27a}). Yet, however, this seems slightly odd-sounding, so the
strategy in (\ref{ex:clitics_27b}) is preferrable, which avoids the problem
altogether by making the names an apposition to the demonstrative\index{pronouns!demonstrative}
\xayr{EdnY}{edanya}{this/these one(s)}.\footnote{It is cases like this where
you wish it were possible to ask the judgment of a speaker of your conlang
instead of relying on your own intuition%
% ---which is often tainted by interference from your native language

\label{clitics_preadj_da}
Of the deictic\index{deixis} prefixes\index{prefixes}, \rayr{d/}{da-} is not only available to verbs and
nouns, but also to adjectives\index{adjectives}. Like with verbs, it is short for \xayr{dnY}
{danya}{(such) one} in this case, as demonstrated in (\ref{ex:clitics_28a}).
The resulting meaning is `the \textsc{adjective} one'; \rayr{d/}{da-}
essentially acts as a nominalizer\index{nominalization}, at least to the extent that the compound of
\rayr{d/}{da-} and an adjective\index{adjectives} inherits the distributional properties of
\rayr{dnY}{danya} as a demonstrative pronoun\index{pronouns!demonstrative}. Thus, it can be case-\index{case} and 
topic-marked\index{grammatical function!topic}, as shown by (\ref{ex:clitics_28}bc). It can also be modified by
another adjective\index{adjectives}, as in (\ref{ex:clitics_28c}). On the other hand, it cannot
be reduplicated for diminution, and also cannot be pluralized\index{number!plural}. Since
adjectives\index{adjectives} follow\index{word order} their heads, the original order\index{word order} of
\textsc{demonstrative}--\textsc{adjective} remains intact. \rayr{d/}{da-} is
thus similar in distribution to English\index{English} simple clitics such as \fw{'ll}, which
occurs in the same place as its full form, the future tense auxiliary
\fw{will}.

The prefix\index{prefixes}, again, coheres tightly in that no additional material can be
inserted. Like with nouns above, inflecting each form in a group of coordinated\index{coordination}
adjectives\index{adjectives} results in an individuating reading, as in (\ref{ex:clitics_29a}). It
should be possible for the prefix\index{prefixes} to take wide scope\index{scope}, as in
(\ref{ex:clitics_29b}). However, it seems better to me to instead rephrase the
coordinated\index{coordination} adjective\index{adjectives} as a relative clause like in (\ref{ex:clitics_29c}), for
instance, besides using the full form \rayr{dnY}{danya} + adjectives\index{adjectives}. Since
case\index{case} is obligatorily marked on every conjunct, (\ref{ex:clitics_29d}) is not
grammatical.

Possessive pronouns like \xayr{naa}{nā}{my}, \xayr{vn}{vana}{your}, etc.\
behave the same way when derived\index{derivation} from their usual role as modifiers to
free-standing anaphoras (\xayr{d/naa}{da-nā}{mine},
\xayr{d/vn}{da-vana}{yours}, etc.), except they cannot themselves be modified
by adjectives\index{adjectives} in the way \xayr{d/tuvo}{da- tuvo}{the red one} is in
(\ref{ex:clitics_28c}). Taking all of the examples above into account,
\rayr{d/}{da-} with adjectives\index{adjectives} and possessive pronouns\index{pronouns!possessive} seems to be most like a
simple clitic according to \posscite{zwicky1977} definition, compared to the
other contexts it can appear in:

\blockcquote[5]{zwicky1977}{Cases where a free morpheme, when unaccented, may
be phonologically subordinated to a neighboring word. Cliticization of this
sort is usually associated with stylistic conditions, as in the casual speech
cliticization of object pronouns in English; there are both formal \emph{full}
pronouns and casual \emph{reduced} pronouns.}

Typical of a simple clitic as well, the distribution of \rayr{d/}{da-} is
restricted by grammatical context, as pointed out regarding example
(\ref{ex:clitics_27b}). Unlike in English\index{English}, which \citet{zwicky1977} gives
examples of, the condition in Ayeri is likely not merely phonological in this
case. However, the nature of the condition is not determined in
\citet{spencerluis2012}, when they elaborate on \posscite{zwicky1977} definition
that

\blockcquote[44]{spencerluis2012}{we may therefore need to define simple
clitics along the lines of \citet{halpern1998}, namely, as clitics that may be
positioned in a subset of the positions within which the full forms are found,
rather than as clitics that have the same distribution as their full-form
counterparts as in \citet{zwicky1977}. Under this broader definition, we
capture the fact that simple clitics differ from special clitics in that they
can appear in some of the positions that are occupied by their corresponding
full forms, while special clitics never can.}

\label{clitics_prenoun_ku}
Besides deictic prefixes\index{prefixes}, nouns\index{nouns} may also receive a prefix\index{prefixes} expressing likeness,
\rayr{ku/}{ku-}. This prefix\index{prefixes} is also applicable to adjectives\index{adjectives}, and is maybe
more adverbial in terms of semantics than purely functional morphemes like
\rayr{d/} {da-}. In contrast to \rayr{d/}{da-}, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} has no 
full-form equivalent. Some examples of it leaning on nouns are given in
(\ref{ex:clitics_30}). Like the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes}, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} appears in a
position which is restricted to functional morphemes. Any other modifiers
which appear as free words or phrases (adjectives\index{adjectives}, relative clauses\index{relative clause}, nominal
adjuncts\index{grammatical function!adjunct}) follow\index{constituent order} nouns and cannot appear in the position of \rayr{ku/}{ku-}.
Slightly untypical of a clitic, again, it is not fully `promiscuous' regarding
its  phonological host in that it requires a nominal, adjectival or phrasal
host.

Generally, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} fulfills the function of the preposition \fw{like}
in English\index{English} in (\ref{ex:clitics_30}). However, if it were a preposition in
Ayeri, it should trigger the locative on its dependent. In the examples above,
however, the NP which \rayr{ku/}{ku-} modifies takes the patient case, like
predicative\index{grammatical function!predicative complement} NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase} are otherwise wont to do. Moreover, while prepositions like
\xayr{koNF}{kong}{inside} in (\ref{ex:clitics_31}) are free morphemes in Ayeri,
\rayr{ku/}{ku-} is bound, which becomes apparent by introducing a parenthetical
remark in (\ref{ex:clitics_32}).

Examples (\ref{ex:clitics_30}ab) show that similar to the deictic prefixes\index{prefixes},
\rayr{ku/}{ku-} precedes its target of modification and can have wide scope\index{scope}
over coordinated\index{coordination} NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase}. As (\ref{ex:clitics_30c}) shows, narrow scope\index{scope} is possible
as well, and in this case, again, each conjunct is to be interpreted separately
instead of \rayr{ku/}{ku-} modifying both conjuncts collectively. As
illustrated in (\ref{ex:clitics_30d}), \rayr{ku/}{ku-} even precedes
\rayr{Ad/}{ada-} as a deictic prefix\index{prefixes}, for instance, if they appear together.
Reversing the order\index{affix order} of the prefixes\index{prefixes} is not possible, as is shown in
(\ref{ex:clitics_30f}). As (\ref{ex:clitics_30e}) shows, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} may
also have scope\index{scope} over two individuated NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} conjuncts. Besides nouns,
\rayr{ku/}{ku-} is applicable to pronouns\index{pronouns} as well, which makes
(\ref{ex:clitics_33}) possible, for example.

With proper nouns\index{nouns!proper}, the same distributional properties as with common nouns
apply, except that \rayr{ku/}{ku-} appears, rather idiosyncratically, as a
suffix\index{suffixes} at the right edge of an NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}---or at the right edge of the first\index{word order} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}
conjunct---if the NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} is preceded by a case\index{case} marker, as shown in
(\ref{ex:clitics_34}). \label{clitics_preadj_ku} With adjectives\index{adjectives}, however,
there are no idiosyncrasies to this degree. \rayr{ku/}{ku-} appears only as a
prefix\index{prefixes} here, as with common nouns, compare (\ref{ex:clitics_35}).

\end{figure}

As (\ref{ex:clitics_35b}) shows, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} can have wide scope\index{scope} over
conjuncts. What further distinguishes \rayr{ku/}{ku-} from a prefix\index{prefixes} here is
that it does not undergo crasis if the adjective\index{adjectives} begins with an /u/, hence we find
\rayr{ku/Ubo}{ku-ubo} /kuˈubo/ `like bitter', not *\,\rayr{kuubo}{*kūbo}
/ˈkuːbo/. Again, the position \rayr{ku/}{ku-} appears in is special in that
whatever modifies adjectives\index{adjectives} usually trails after\index{word order} them.

\label{clitics_preverb_ku}
Besides attaching to words, \rayr{ku/}{ku-} is furthermore able to subordinate
infinite\index{verbs!infinite} CPs\index{phrase types!complementizer phrase}. Since \rayr{ku/}{ku-} leans on a whole phrase in
(\ref{ex:clitics_36}), which affixes (at least in Ayeri) otherwise cannot do,
its status as a clitic should be unmistakable in this context. That is,
\xayr{thymF misuNsF}{tahayam misungas}{having a secret} forms a clausal
complement\index{complement clause} of \xayr{silFvYeNF}{silvyeng}{she looks} which is analyzed here as
being modified as a unit by \rayr{ku/}{ku-}. If \rayr{ku/}{ku-} were a simple
prefix\index{prefixes}, it would only be able to modify a word, but not the whole phrase.

\begin{figure}

\subsubsection{Suffixes}
\label{subsubsec:suffixes}
\index{suffixes|(}

\label{clitics_postverb_person}
Besides a number of prefixes and particles occuring before lexical heads which
are likely clitics, Ayeri also has a number of morphemes trailing lexical heads
as suffixes which do not seem quite like typical inflection. These are, for
one, part of the person suffixes on the verb. Especially tricky in this regard
is maybe that \textquote{a pronominal affix or incorporated pronominal is
effectively a clitic masquerading as an affix. Therefore, if there are
pronominal affixes, they should behave exactly like clitics with respect to
crucial aspects of morphosyntax} \parencites[144]{spencerluis2012}[also
compare][101]{corbett2006}. For illustration, \citet{spencerluis2012} provide
examples from Breton\index{Breton} and Irish\index{Irish} where the person marking on the verb is in
complementary distribution with full NPs, as illustrated in
(\ref{ex:clitics_37}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_38}).

What we can see in (\ref{ex:clitics_37}) is that, according to
\citet{spencerluis2012}, the verb shows no number marking, defaulting to the
singular form, in non-negative clauses if the subject of the verb is overt as
either a full noun or a pronoun: plural marking on the verb and a full subject
cannot coincide in this case, which is why (\ref{ex:clitics_37c}) is marked
ungrammatical. In (\ref{ex:clitics_38a}) we can see that there is no need for
an explicit first-person pronoun, since that function is already expressed by
person marking on the verb. Person inflection on the verb seems to be in
complementary distribution with full subject pronouns at least for some parts
of the paradigm. In (\ref{ex:clitics_38b}) we have an overt second-person
subject pronoun, but in this case, the verb does not agree with it and instead
defaults to the third-person form, a clear case of which is given in
(\ref{ex:clitics_38c}).

While there is no defaulting\index{default} to a certain person\index{person} in the presence of
an overt subject\index{grammatical function!subject} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} as such in Ayeri, there is still the effect of complementary
distribution between a pronominal suffix in the absence of an overt subject\index{grammatical function!subject} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase},
and a functionally impoverished as well as phonologically reduced form in its
presence, compare examples (\ref{ex:clitics_39}) through (\ref{ex:clitics_41}).

Example (\ref{ex:clitics_39}b) shows the free form of the third singular
masculine agent pronoun, \xayr{yaaNF}{yāng}{he}. This is in complementary
distribution\index{complementary distribution} with a full NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, which in (\ref{ex:clitics_39}a) is \rayr{ANF
niysF}{ang Niyas}. In (\ref{ex:clitics_40}a) we can see that the verb agrees
with the subject\index{grammatical function!subject} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} in person\index{person}, gender and number\index{number} in that it exhibits the suffix
\rayr{/y}{-ya}. If, like in (\ref{ex:clitics_40}b), the overt subject\index{grammatical function!subject} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} is
missing, the verb\index{verbs} is marked with the same form as the free pronoun,
\rayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}, which feeds the verb\index{verbs} as a syntactic argument. That is,
the person\index{person} suffix itself realizes the \Subj{} function of the verb's\index{verbs} argument
structure; no other exponent of person\index{person} features is required, as
(\ref{ex:clitics_41}) illustrates. The definitions in (\ref{ex:clitics_42})
list the constituent parts of \xayr{lMpYaaNF}{lampyāng}{he walks} and their
associated grammatical features.\footnote{Normally, due to the lexical
integrity principle, \rayr{lMpYaaNF}{lampyāng} should be listed as one, but
Ayeri's very regular agglutinating nature makes splitting composed words very
convenient for illustration as in this case.}

Example (\ref{ex:clitics_43}) is an attempt to conceptualize in a formal way
that functionally, the inflection takes the role of the subject\index{grammatical function!subject} relation. This also explains why
(\ref{ex:clitics_41}a) is ungrammatical: the pronominal suffix
\rayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng} on the verb\index{verbs} is redundant in the presence of a full NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}
which expresses the same features. In effect, what is attempted in
(\ref{ex:clitics_41}), is to fill a grammatical function with essentially the
same content in two places, which is redundant. Assuming a `$pro$' value for
the \Pred{} feature of \xayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}{he} is \Lfg{}'s\index{Lexical-functional grammar} (\cite{bresnan1982} onwards; also see \autoref{sec:lfg}) way to
model the fact that this pronominal suffix functions as a pro-form available
for predication, like a pronoun\index{pronouns}. Pronouns and full NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase} necessarily exclude\index{complementary distribution} each
other, however.

Example (\ref{ex:clitics_44}) shows, then, the annotations for
\xayr{lMpY}{lampya}{walks} as agreeing with an overt NP. Here, the suffix does
not have a \Pred{} feature---it is not available for predication, so that a
full NP is permissible as a controller of agreement\index{agreement} in the clause, with the
person\index{person} suffix as its person-inflection agreement\index{agreement} target. The agreement\index{agreement} suffix
\rayr{/y}{-ya} thus reflects that the subject\index{grammatical function!subject} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} needs to have a certain set of
person\index{person} features. The NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} which controls verb agreement\index{agreement} (in canonical cases the
agent\index{case!agent} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}) needs to match these features in order to establish an agreement\index{agreement}
relationship. By constraining (\req{}) the subject's\index{grammatical function!subject} predicator to not be a
pro-form in (\ref{ex:clitics_44}), it should also be possible to rule out cases
like in (\ref{ex:clitics_41b}), where person\index{person} agreement\index{agreement} is triggered by a
pronominal NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}.
% This is ungrammatical, since Ayeri basically supplants person\index{person}
% agreement\index{agreement} with a pronominal suffix in those cases, as we have seen.
If \rayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng} were a simple inflectional affix, one of the two
examples in (\ref{ex:clitics_41}) should be grammatical.

\end{tabu}

\end{morphlex}
\end{figure}

The behavior of pronominal person\index{person} marking on the verb is rather
complex, and decidedly unlike inflection in that what looks like an affix on
the verb is also an argument of it, like a pronoun\index{pronouns}, as displayed in
(\ref{ex:clitics_42}). Another layer of complexity is added by the fact that
such an incorporated pronoun\index{pronouns} is also eligible for topicalization\index{grammatical function!topic}. As we have
seen above, topic marking on nouns\index{nouns} is realized by suppressing the realization
of the overt case\index{case} marker, whether it is a proclitic or a suffix. The
topic-marked\index{grammatical function!topic} forms of pronouns\index{pronouns} are also underspecified for case\index{case}, and they
happen to be the same as those of the person-agreement\index{person}\index{agreement} suffixes, as exemplified
by \rayr{/y}{-ya} in (\ref{ex:clitics_40a}). Thus, a topic-marked\index{grammatical function!topic} pronominal
suffix on the verb will look exactly like ordinary agreement\index{agreement} with a full NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase},
except that there is no full NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} to agree with---hence the subscript numbers in
(\ref{ex:clitics_44}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_45}) to distinguish between both
kinds of \rayr{/y}{-ya}.\footnote{Assuming that the person\index{person} suffix on the verb
always co-indexes the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} and that it is therefore unnecessary to distinguish
a person-agreement\index{person}\index{agreement} suffix from a homophonous topicalized\index{grammatical function!topic} pronominal suffix is a
premature conclusion. In fact, the verb\index{verbs} always agrees with its subject\index{grammatical function!subject}, which
is most often the agent\index{case!agent} NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}. The topic\index{grammatical function!topic} may consist of any NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, also oblique\index{grammatical function!oblique} ones.
The verb\index{verbs} generally does not agree with non-agent or non-patient NPs\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, however.}

Comparing the feature list in (\ref{ex:clitics_45}) with that in
(\ref{ex:clitics_42}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_44}), we see that
(\ref{ex:clitics_45}) is basically the same as (\ref{ex:clitics_42}), except
that either the \Case{} feature is absent, or that the suffix is
underspecified for case\index{case}. In absence of an NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} to agree with, it follows from
this definitional lack that the person\index{person} marking on the verb\index{verbs} itself is to be
identified as constituting the topic\index{grammatical function!topic}, and the correspondent of the preverbal
topic\index{grammatical function!topic} marker. In the following case, the preverbal topic marker defines that
the topic is an animate agent; this information is united with the functional
annotations in (\ref{ex:clitics_45}).

		\end{tabular}

\xe
\end{morphlex}
\end{figure}

Instances of other case-unmarked\index{case} nouns\index{nouns} can be ruled out as being also part of
the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} relation on the grounds of cohesion and functional uniqueness: if the
topic\index{grammatical function!topic} is defined as an agent and it cannot be assumed from context that the
case-unmarked\index{case} noun\index{nouns} in question is also part of the agent NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase}, discard it as a
candidate.\footnote{As described in \autoref{subsec:relcs}, there may be
multiple topics\index{grammatical function!topic} under very limited circumstances.} Besides, every core thematic
role (agent\index{semantic role!agent}, patient\index{semantic role!patient}, recipient\index{semantic role!recipient}) can only be assigned once, so if the role
specified by the topic\index{grammatical function!topic} marker is already assigned, another NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} in the same
clause cannot also be assigned the same role. This gets more difficult with
non-core roles, though it may be assumed\index{desiderata} that oblique\index{grammatical function!oblique} arguments are less likely
to be topicalized\index{grammatical function!topic}.

Possibly confusing with regards to the status of the pronominal suffixes as
cli\-tics is that \textcquote[144]{spencerluis2012}{a pronominal affix or
incorporated pronominal is effectively a clitic masquerading as an affix}.
While the pronominal suffixes in Ayeri behave in a special way regarding
syntax, they lack wide scope\index{scope}, which is typical of affixes (apart from the
examples from Turkish\index{Turkish} in (\ref{ex:clitics_23})). Unlike Breton\index{Breton} in
(\ref{ex:clitics_37}) or Irish\index{Irish} in (\ref{ex:clitics_38}), Ayeri's pronominal
affixes do not default\index{default} to some form, and verbs\index{verbs} cannot be unmarked either, that
is, verbs\index{verbs} always have to be inflected in some way, mostly for phonotactic
reasons. Thus, in coordination\index{coordination}, every conjunct has to be inflected for person\index{person}
features, as (\ref{ex:clitics_47}) shows.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

In the case of \xayr{nedFr/}{nedra-}{sit} and \xayr{ly/}{laya-}{read} in
(\ref{ex:clitics_47}), leaving off the person\index{person} marking would theoretically
generate valid words, since *\rayr{nedFr}{*nedra} and *\rayr{ly}{*laya} satisfy
phonotactic constraints (see \autoref{sec:phonotactics}). However, Ayeri also
has a great number of verb stems which end in a consonant cluster\index{consonants!clusters}, such as
\xayr{AnFlF/}{anl-}{bring} or \xayr{tpY/}{tapy-}{set}, which do not form valid
words as bare stems since words cannot end in CC. What would be possible
instead is that one conjunct might carry the full pronominal suffix as a
`strong' form and the other one might only partially co-index the required
features by using the less specific corresponding agreement\index{agreement} marker as a `weak'
form. Differential marking of this kind, though, is simply not established.

\label{clitics_quant}\index{quantifiers|(}
After briefly delving into the realm of syntax, let us return to morphology for
the second group of suffixes which need clarification. While Ayeri has
quantifiers which are independent words, there are also a number of very common
`little' quantifiers and intensifiers\index{intensifiers} which are customarily spelled as
suffixes, for instance, \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{much, many; very},
\xayr{/kj}{kay}{few; a little}, \xayr{/nm}{nama}{just, only}, and
\xayr{/nYm}{-nyama}{even}. All of these are determining in meaning and while
they are comparatively light in their semantics compared to regular content
words, they do not particularly resemble functional morphemes either.

A natural language which also contains suffixed quantifiers is West Greenlandic\index{West Greenlandic}
\citep{bittner1995}. According to \posscite{bittner1995} terminology,
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} in Ayeri as modifying a noun would be a D-quantifier, since
it forms \textcquote[59]{bittner1995}{a constituent [with] a projection of N}.
This is in contrast to A-quantifiers, which are defined as forming
\textcquote[59]{bittner1995}{a constituent with some projection of V}. That is,
A-quantifiers are quantifiers like \fw{almost} (\rayr{/NsF}{-ngas} in Ayeri),
\fw{mostly}, or \fw{never}, which modify verbs\index{verbs}, while D-quantifiers are words
like \fw{most}, \fw{some}, or \fw{every}, which modify nouns\index{nouns}. Ayeri makes no
distinction between A- and D-quantifiers with regards to their being treated as
suffixes, however, so that one may find suffixed quantifiers in both groups,
sometimes even to the extent that the same quantifier may modify both nouns or
verbs\index{verbs}. Example (\ref{ex:clitics_48}) gives two instances of suffixed
quantifiers from West Greenlandic\index{West Greenlandic} for comparison with Ayeri in
(\ref{ex:clitics_49}).

As we can see in (\ref{ex:clitics_48a}), West Greenlandic\index{West Greenlandic} incorporates the
quantifier suffixes into the verb. Ayeri---not a polysynthetic\index{synthesis}
language---proceeds more freely in (\ref{ex:clitics_49a}), in that
\xayr{tdyenF}{tadayen}{always, every time} is an adverb\index{adverbs} and as such a free
morpheme. Thus, it can be modified by a suffixed quantifier in turn. Since
orthography may be treacherous, let us first try to establish whether
\xayr{/NsF}{-ngas}{almost} and \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{many, much, very} and their
like are free morphemes or not. As discussed initially regarding the preverbal
particles, it is possible to reorder\index{word order} free morphemes, while clitics---as bound
morphemes---cannot move around. Adverbs and adjectives\index{adjectives} are, if they optionally
add additional information to a lexical head, adjuncts\index{grammatical function!adjunct}, and according to
\citet{carnie2013} it is possible for adjuncts\index{grammatical function!adjunct} to switch places within the same
syntactic domain. Adjuncts can also be coordinated\index{coordination} with other adjuncts\index{grammatical function!adjunct} in the
same syntactic domain. Furthermore, it is possible to replace \xbar{X} nodes
with pro-forms, like \fw{one} in English\index{English}.

As (\ref{ex:clitics_50}cd) shows, moving \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{many, much, very}
into different positions results not necessarily in ungrammatical expressions,
but in expressions with meanings different from what was intended, since
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan}'s scope\index{scope} changes from the noun to the adjective it is
appended to. On the other hand, comparing (\ref{ex:clitics_50a}) and (b), it is
possible for \xayr{kaarYo}{kāryo}{big} and \xayr{bino}{bino}{colorful} to
switch places with no ill effects. Example (\ref{ex:clitics_51b}) demonstrates
that placing a coordinating conjunction between \rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} and
\rayr{bino}{bino} does not work. The coordination\index{coordination} in (\ref{ex:clitics_51c}), on
the other hand, is not a problem---not because it is possible to coordinate
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} and \rayr{kaarYo}{kāryo}, but because
\xayr{bino/IknF}{bino-ikan}{very colorful} is considered one syntactic unit
which is coordinated\index{coordination} with \rayr{kaarYo}{kāryo}. Thus, in
(\ref{ex:clitics_50b}), we have actually been trying to coordinate
\xayr{kipisaanYe/IknF}{kipisānye-ikan}{many paintings} with \xayr{bino}{bino}
{colorful}, which does not work, since it is not possible to coordinate a
lexical head with an adjunct\index{grammatical function!adjunct} supposed to modify it, because they are of
different syntactic categories. In this regard it is worth mentioning that
Ayeri's quantifier suffixes are rather not complements either, since they are
not required to satisfy their head's argument structure.

One might argue that (\ref{ex:clitics_50}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_51}) is like
comparing apples to oranges in that \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{many, much, very} and
\xayr{bino}{bino}{colorful} are of different categories, since they do not
appear to operate on the same levels. So instead, let us investigate
possibilities of word order change and coordination between different
quantifiers to ensure keeping the syntactic level constant. With this comes the
problem, however, that it seems strange to modify the same lexical head with
multiple different quantifiers, so this test does not really seem suitable to
produce grammatical results. Also, with regards to coordination\index{coordination} of quantifiers,
it is maybe more natural to oppose them with \xayr{soyNF}{soyang}{or} than to
coordinate them; the grammatical structure of two categorially identical
elements connected by a grammatical conjunction\index{conjunctions} (even if the meaning is
disjunctive) remains the same in either case.

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_52}
\a\label{ex:clitics_52a}\ljudge{*}\begingl

	\glft `few or many people' //

\end{figure}

In example (\ref{ex:clitics_52a}) we see that it is indeed not possible to
combine multiple quantifiers to jointly modify a head in the way it is possible
for multiple adjectives\index{adjectives} to modify the same head as in (\ref{ex:clitics_50a}),
for instance. The example of quantifier disjunction in (\ref{ex:clitics_52b})
is also odd unless we permit a reading where
\xayr{kejnmF}{keynam}{people} has been suppressed in the second disjunct to
avoid repetition, although in the corresponding case of (\ref{ex:clitics_53b})
below, \xayr{d/kj}{da-kay}{few ones} would be preferable.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Both tests, moving \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{many, much, very} into other positions
and coordination\index{coordination}, have failed so far, and we have evidence that
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} forms a syntactic unit with its head, which points to it
being a bound morpheme similar to an affix. As with free words, it is also
possible to replace a quantifier's head with a pro-form, as mentioned above in
the comment on (\ref{ex:clitics_53b}), and shown in more detail in
(\ref{ex:clitics_54}). With quantifier suffixes there seems to be an overlap
between word-like and affix-like properties, which is typical of clitics.

Somewhat untypical of affixes, it seems to be possible to modify suffixed
quantifiers with intensifiers\index{intensifiers} like \xayr{EkenF}{ekeng}{too} and
\xayr{kgnF}{kagan}{far too}, as (\ref{ex:clitics_55}) shows. This suggests
that at least in this context, \xayr{/IknF}{-ikan}{many, much, very} may
actually be the lexical head of a DP\index{phrase types!determiner phrase}, which creates the need for
some additional morpholexic rules in its definition.

\begin{figure}
\ex\label{ex:clitics_55}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ vacyan keynam-ikan kagan disuley. //
	\glb ang= vac-yan keynam-Ø=ikan kagan disu-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{}= like-\TplM{} people-\Top{}=many far.too disu-\PargI{} //
	\glft `Far too many people like bananas.' //
\endgl\xe
\end{figure}

Inserting parenthetical word material in between morphemes as a test for
coherence may be especially interesting in the face of (\ref{ex:clitics_55}).
Here, it is not entirely clear whether \xayr{kejnmF/IknF kgnF}{keynam-ikan
kagan}{too many people} forms a single unit, or whether \xayr{kgnF}{kagan}{far
too} is a modifier of \xayr{kejnmF/IknF}{keynam-ikan}{many people}. Since signs
point to the status of suffixed quantifiers as clitics, it is possible that
\xayr{/IknF kgnF}{-ikan kagan}{far too many} constitutes a clitic cluster
similar to the preverbal one. Example (\ref{ex:clitics_56}), therefore, lists
examples which try to split up the expression at every relevant point. According
to this test, it looks indeed as though \rayr{kejnmF/IknF kgnF}{keynam-ikan
kagan} forms a syntactic unit, in that \rayr{/IknF kgnF}{-ikan kagan} cannot be
split up internally and also cannot be divided from \rayr{/IknF}{-ikan}'s head,
\xayr{kejnmF}{keynam}{people}. On the other hand, it is also possible to use
other adverbs\index{adverbs} like \xayr{ptu}{patu}{surprisingly} with
quantifiers, as in (\ref{ex:patuquant_1}).

The question here as well is whether \rayr{ptu}{patu} refers to just 
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} or to \rayr{kejnmF/IknF}{keynam-ikan}. Replacing
\rayr{kejnmF}{keynam} with a pronoun produces a grammatical outcome
(\ref{ex:patuquant_2_keynam}); doing so with \rayr{kejnmF/IknF}{keynam-ikan},
however, does not (\ref{ex:patuquant_2_keynamikan}). Replacing just
\rayr{/IknF}{-ikan} at good last produces a very questionable expression as
well, however (\ref{ex:patuquant_2_ikan}). The syntactic constituency of
suffixed quantifiers will be elaborated on in \autoref{subsubsec:quantsyn}
(p.~\pageref{subsubsec:quantsyn}).

Another interesting distributional property of suffixed quantifiers in Ayeri is
that in spite of their being suffixed (for instance, to verbs), they can form
arguments of the verb\index{verbs}, similar to pronominal suffixes. Thus, with verbs like
\xayr{koMd/}{kond-}{eat}, \xayr{/m}{\mbox{-ma}}{enough} appears suffixed to the verb
instead of as a predicative\index{grammatical function!predicative complement} DP\index{phrase types!determiner phrase}. Incidentally, the examples in
(\ref{ex:clitics_57}) also show that a quantifier attaches after pronominal
suffixes, which we have already established as being clitics. An inflectional
affix would not normally appear in post-clitic position, which is further
evidence to the hypothesis that quantifier suffixes in Ayeri are clitics.

\begin{figure}

Since Ayeri possesses a zero copula\index{copula}, equative phrases\index{copular clause} which treat quantifier
suffixes as predicative\index{grammatical function!predicative complement} adverbs\index{adverbs} pose a difficulty in that quantifier suffixes
cannot stand alone like predicatives\index{grammatical function!predicative complement} normally would. Thus, similar to the
behavior of \xayr{/m}{-ma}{enough} in (\ref{ex:clitics_57a}), the predicative\index{grammatical function!predicative complement}
\rayr{/m}{-ma} in (\ref{ex:clitics_58b}) cliticizes to the only available word:
the subject\index{grammatical function!subject}, \xayr{AdreNF}{adareng}{that}.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

If quantifier suffixes are clitics, they should also have wide scope\index{scope} over
conjuncts. Here as well, quantifier suffixes behave like typical clitics
in that they can have scope\index{scope} over a conjunct as a whole, although not
totally unambiguously\index{ambiguity} so. Thus, in (\ref{ex:clitics_59a}), while \rayr{koyaasF
nj kihsFlej/IknF}{koyās nay kihasley-ikan} is translated as `many books and
maps' (nouns\index{nouns} do not mark plural\index{number!plural} if modified by a quantifier which indicates
plurality\index{number!plural}), another possible reading is `a book and many maps'. Ways to force
the latter reading explicitly are, for one, to use \xayr{koyaasF menF}{koyās
men}{one/a single book}, or alternatively, to reduplicate the coordinator
\xayr{nj}{nay}{and} to \xayr{njnj} {naynay}{and also}. Context should be
sufficient to indicate the correct reading of (\ref{ex:clitics_59a}) under
normal circustances, however. The same applies to (\ref{ex:clitics_59b}), where
the non-distributive reading can be made explicit by using \rayr{njnj}{naynay}
instead of simple \rayr{nj}{nay}. In both (\ref{ex:clitics_59a}) and (b), if
the first conjunct is modified by an adjective, the distribution of the
quantifier over both conjuncts is also blocked. Thus, in
(\ref{ex:clitics_60a}), there is `a big book and many maps', and in
(\ref{ex:clitics_60b}) `the dog' is `surprisingly clever and pretty quick'.

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_60}
\a\label{ex:clitics_60a}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ tahisayan koyās kāryo nay kihasley-ikan. //
	\glb ang= tahisa=yan.Ø koya-as kāryo nay kihas-ley=ikan //

		\textit{Not:} `The dog is surprisingly pretty clever and quick.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

The interpretations marked as errorneous in (\ref{ex:clitics_60}) can be
correctly achieved by ordinarily placing the adjective after\index{word order} the coordinated\index{coordination}
constituent so that the adjective itself has scope\index{scope} over both conjuncts. This is
demonstrated in (\ref{ex:clitics_61}) and (\ref{ex:clitics_62}). Again, an
unambiguous\index{ambiguity} and individuating interpretation can be achieved by placing the
quantifier suffix on each conjunct.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

The comparative\index{comparison} suffixes on adjectives, \rayr{/ENF}{-eng} (\Comp{}) and
\rayr{/vaa}{-vā} (\Supl{}) are obviously derived from their quantifier
counterparts meaning `rather' and `most', which poses a slight problem: it is
not entirely clear whether they act as clitics as well, or whether
grammaticalization\index{grammaticalization} has stripped them of some of the
clitic-like properties of quantifier suffixes. Consider, for instance, example
(\ref{ex:clitics_comp}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_comp}
\a\label{ex:clitics_comp1}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ koronya {} @ Kaman apyanas palay nay ban-eng. //

		\textit{or:} `Kaman knows a rather funny joke and (also a) rather good 
		one.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

All examples in (\ref{ex:clitics_comp}) show that in principle, an
interpretation of \rayr{/ENF}{-eng} as a quantifier and as a
comparative\index{comparison} suffix are both legitimate. Thus, it is difficult
to distinguish between an inflectional affix and a clitic here. A clear
distinction also cannot be made on phonological grounds in that even in the
reading as a quantifier clitic, \rayr{/ENF}{-eng} (\Comp{}) and \rayr{/vaa}{-vā}
(\Supl{}) are stressed\index{stress}
\parencite[compare][90--92]{spencerluis2012}. With \rayr{/ENF}{-eng} it is
possible at least to test whether it undergoes crasis if appended to an
adjective\index{adjectives} stem ending in \rayr{/E}{-e}. As we have seen,
however, this is not a fully reliable metric either in that deictic
prefixes show clitic-like behavior but may still phonologically
meld with the stem they attach to. The only adjective\index{adjectives} ending
in \rayr{/E}{-e} currently listed in the dictionary is
\xayr{nke}{nake}{large, tall}. What happens when \rayr{nke}{nake} is combined
with both kinds of \rayr{/ENF}{-eng} is illustrated in (\ref{ex:clitics_nake}).

\begin{figure}
\pex\label{ex:clitics_nake}
\a\label{ex:clitics_nake1}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ tahayan enonley nake-eng. //
	\glb ang= taha=yan.Ø enon-ley nake=eng //
	\glc \Aarg{}= have=\TplM{}.\Top{} tower-\PargI{} tall=rather //
	\glft `They have a rather tall tower.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:clitics_nake2}\begingl
	\gla Ang @ tahayan enonley si nakēng da-nana. //
	\glb ang= taha=yan.Ø enon-ley si nake-eng da=nana-na //

		one=\Fpl{}.\Gen{}-\Gen{} //
	\glft `They have a tower taller than ours.' //
\endgl
\xe
\end{figure}

As illustrated by (\ref{ex:clitics_nake2}), the purely comparative\index{comparison} variant of
\rayr{/ENF}{-eng} should be able to be affected by crasis of two alike vowels.
Since adjectives\index{adjectives} in \rayr{/E}{-e} are exceedingly rare, though, this
observation should not matter much in effect.

\section{Marking strategies}
\label{sec:markstrat}

With regards to the dichotomy head--dependent marking, Ayeri is rather  
thoroughly dependent marking, albeit with the exception of agreement\index{agreement} 
morphology on the verb\index{verbs}. Dependent marking\index{marking strategies!dependent-marking} is exhibited, for instance, in the 
expression of possessive relationships, where the dependent is marked for 
genitive case\index{case!genitive}:

In (\ref{ex:gennoun}), \rayr{tuvo}{Tuvo} is grammatically in possession of her 
\xayr{dem}{dema}{aunt}; the possessee forms the head of the phrase while it is 
modified by the possessor\index{semantic role!possessor}, which receives the marking. In (\ref{ex:genprn}), 
\xayr{ksu}{kasu}{basket} forms the head and thus also the possessee, while 
\xayr{naa}{nā}{my} serves as the dependent possessor\index{semantic role!possessor}; the genitive case is, 
then again, marked on the dependent. A further example of dependent marking\index{marking strategies!dependent-marking} is 
the locative case\index{case!locative}, which is marked on the prepositional object\index{grammatical function!adpositional object} while the 
preposition\index{adpositions!prepositions} itself, as the head of the PP\index{phrase types!prepositional phrase}, does not receive marking:

The relativizer\index{pronouns!relative}, likewise, may agree in case\index{case} with the NP in the matrix clause
to which it links the relative clause\index{relative clause}. This typically happens mainly in formal
language and---in terms of linear succession of words at the surface level of
the clause---if the relativizer\index{pronouns!relative} cannot be immediately adjacent to the NP which
the relative clause\index{relative clause} modifies, for example, when an adjective\index{adjectives} or a possessive
pronoun\index{pronouns!possessive} is following\index{word order} the noun\index{nouns}:

The only instance of head-marking\index{marking strategies!head-marking} there is in Ayeri is person-marking\index{person} on the
verb\index{verbs}, which manifests when the NP following\index{constituent order} the verb\index{verbs} (agent or patient) is not
pronominal and thus there is no pronoun\index{pronouns} to cliticize to the verb\index{verbs} stem, but the
verb\index{verbs} still receives a suffix\index{suffixes} that indicates a relation with, usually, the agent
NP:

in topicality, since topic\index{grammatical function!topic} and case\index{case} are no categories the verb\index{verbs} normally
inflects for. In terms of syntax, however, the topicalized NP\index{phrase types!noun phrase} depends on the verb\index{verbs},
so the relationship is mutual, though on different levels---morphology and
syntax.

In this example, the verb exhibits canonic agreement with the agent, 
\rayr{AgYaanF}{Ajān}, in person, gender, and number. It is additionally marked 
for a patient topic, \rayr{pil}{Pila}, and thus serves as an agreement target
for two different controller NPs. As far as morphology is concerned, topic\index{grammatical function!topic}
marking on the verb is an instance of head marking.
