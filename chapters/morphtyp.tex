\chapter{Morphological typology}
\index{typology!of morphemes|(}

The first chapter dealt with the smallest constituent parts of words---speech 
sounds, which ones there are, and how they assemble into valid words. 
Consequentially, the following chapters will be about the next step up from 
this: morphemes, the atoms of meaning. First we will have a more general look 
at which kinds of morphemes there are, and then look at them more closely by 
part of speech. This chapter on morphological typology will first deal with 
general questions about Ayeri's degree of synthesis, and then will try 
to answer questions about the kinds of processes the various morpheme classes 
carry out in the language.

\section{Typology}

For the largest part, Ayeri is an \emph{agglutinative}\index{agglutination} 
language since it modifies word roots with affixes for the purposes of 
inflection and derivation, and these affixes, in the form of 
suffixes\index{suffixes} more specifically, can be stacked, especially on 
verbs; the average number of morphemes per word is thus greater than 1:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le kondasayāng hemaye pruyya nay napayya kayvay. //
	\glb Le kond-asa-yāng hema-ye-Ø pruy-ya nay napay-ya kayvay //
	\glc \PatTI{} eat-\Hab{}=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} egg-\Pl{}-\Top{} salt-\Loc{} 
		and pepper-\Loc{} without //
	\glft `He always eats his eggs without salt and pepper.' //
\endgl\xe

The verb root \xayr{koMd/}{kond-}{eat} is inflected here for a habitual action 
with the suffix \rayr{/As}{-asa}, and also carries a person-inflection clitic, 
\rayr{/yaanF}{-yāng}, marking a third person singular masculine agent. With the 
exception of person-inflection clitics, affixes tend to encode a single 
grammatical function. Verbs are not the only part of speech that can inflect; 
nouns and the relativizing conjunction can as well:

\pex
\a\label{ex:letters}\begingl
	\gla Ang mətahanay tamanyeley yeyam. //
	\glb Ang mə-tahan-ay.Ø taman-ye-ley yeyam. //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Pst{}-write=\Fsg{}.\Top{} letter-\Pl{}-\PargI{} 
		\TsgF{}.\Dat{} //
	\glft `I wrote letters to her.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:relative}\begingl
	\gla Le turayāng taman sinā ang ningay tamala vās. //
	\glb Le tura-yāng taman-Ø si-Ø-na ang ning=ay.Ø tamala vās //
	\glc \PatTI{} send=\Tsg{}.\M{}.\Aarg{} letter-\Top{} 
		\Rel{}-\PatTI{}-\Gen{} \AgtT{} tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday 
		\Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `The letter which I told you about yesterday, he sent it.' //
\endgl
\xe

The principle of not conflating several grammatical functions into a single 
suffix can be observed in (\ref{ex:letters}) regarding the word 
\xayr{tmnFyelej}{tamanyeley}{letters}, in which the plural marker 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye} is distinct from the inanimate-patient case marker 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley}. Strictly speaking, the pronoun \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} 
is also composed, namely of the third person feminine base form \rayr{ye}{ye} 
and the dative case marker \rayr{/ymF}{yam}. Example (\ref{ex:relative}) is one 
we have already encountered before (p.~\pageref{doublerel}). Here, the relative 
pronoun, \xayr{sinaa}{sinā}{of/about which} is inflected for genitive case, and 
stress on the usually unstressed last syllable 
suprasegmentally\index{suprasegments} marks that this form is contracted from 
\rayr{sileyen}{sileyena} (\textit{si-ley-ena}, \Rel{}-\PargI{}-\Gen{}).

So far, we have concentrated on suffixes, but there are a number of 
prefixes\index{prefixes} as well; (\ref{ex:letters}) exhibits the past prefix 
\rayr{m/}{mə-} (which is actually redundant in this case). There are also 
deictic prefixes on nouns, however. In the following example, the clitic 
\xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this-} joins the noun \xayr{pehmF}{peham}{carpet} to indicate a 
specific carpet.

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le no intoyyang eda-peham. //
	\glb Le no int-oy-yang eda-peham-Ø //
	\glc \PatTI{} want buy-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} this=carpet-\Top{} //
	\glft `I do not want to buy this carpet.' //
\endgl\xe

Besides prefixes and suffixes, Ayeri also possesses at least one grammatical 
morpheme of the kind \citet{zwicky1977} calls a `bound word'.\index{bound 
words} These are cases where morphemes which are

\blockcquote[6]{zwicky1977}{always bound and always unaccented show considerable 
syntactic freedom, in the sense that they can be associated with words of a 
variety of morphosyntactic categories. Frequently, such a \emph{bound word} is 
semantically associated with an entire consituent while being phonologically 
attached to one word of this constituent, and ordinarily the bound word is 
located at the very margins of the word, standing outside even inflectional 
affixes.}

This is the case with the marker \rayr{mN}{manga}, which is treated as an 
independent word, but can modify verbs and prepositions---heads of VPs and 
PPs, respectively---is unstressed and appears at the margin of its 
modification target:

\pex
\a\label{ex:prog}\begingl
	\gla Ang manga yavaya ayon bariley. //
	\glb Ang manga yava-ya ayon-Ø bari-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Prog{} roast-\TsgM{} man-\Top{} meat-\PargI{} //
	\glft `The man is frying meat.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:dyn}\begingl
	\gla Ya mətapyyāng maritay misley manga luga bari. //
	\glb Ya mə-tapy-yāng maritay mis-ley manga luga bari-Ø //
	\glc \LocT{} \Pst{}-put=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} before spit-\PargI{} \Dyn{} 
		between meat-\Top{} //
	\glft `The meat, he had put a spit through it before.' //
\endgl

\xe

In (\ref{ex:prog}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the verb \xayr{yv/}{yava-}{roast} 
and indicates that this is a temporarily ongoing action, like the English 
progressive, except not as strongly grammaticalized.\footnote{I suppose, a 
better parallel is the so-called \fw{rheinische Verlaufsform} `Ripuarian 
progressive' in German, a construction common in colloquial German which 
parallels the English progressive construction. However, at least in my own 
variety of colloquial Standard German, it is still at a stage where its use is 
optional rather than obligatory.

\ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em]\begingl
	\gla Der Mann ist Fleisch am Braten. //
	\glc The man is meat at.the frying //
	\glft `The man is frying meat.' //
\endgl\xe}
%
In (\ref{ex:dyn}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the preposition, on the other 
hand, to indicate that it is dynamic: \rayr{lug}{luga} by itself means `among, 
between', while its dynamic form \rayr{mN lug}{manga luga} means `through; 
during, while, for'.

As we have seen in the examples above, person suffixes on verbs are single 
morphemes that encode more than one property, for example \rayr{/yeNF}{-yeng} 
encodes the person features third person, feminine, singular, and agent. 
Personal pronouns, of which the person clitics on verbs are an instance, are 
the main case of fusion among agglutination in Ayeri, although some of the 
forms, like \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} above, can be decomposed into root and 
suffix without problem.\footnote{Originally, Ayeri's pronouns were indeed 
agglutinative as well, so \xayr{yeNF}{yeng}{she} used to be 
\rayr{Iye\_aNF}{iyeang} (\fw{iy-e-ang}, \Tsg{}-\F{}-\Aarg{}). This also gives 
an explanation to \citet{boga2016}'s observation that Ayeri's plural pronouns 
are formed \textcquote[{[}15{]}; `possibly in an even too regular 
way']{boga2016}{[v]ielleicht sogar zu regelmäßig}.}

Perpendicular to the axis isolation–agglutination runs the axis 
analytic–poly\-syn\-thetic. On the latter axis, Ayeri scores mostly as 
\emph{synthetic}, since it prefers compactness over spreading a construction 
over several words. This is how it is theoretically possible to form 
foot-long words like

\ex\begingl
	\gla da-mətahasongoyyang-ikan //
	\glb da=mə-taha-asa-ong-oy=yang=ikan //
	\glc so=\Pst{}-have-\Hab{}-\Irr{}-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}=much //
	\glft `so I would not much used to have had' //
\endgl\xe

Cases of analytic syntax are compound prepositions as we have seen one in 
(\ref{ex:dyn}), but verbs as well show analytic structures not only with the 
progressive marker, but also with modals:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ming sahoyyang dabas. //
	\glb Ming saha-oy-yang dabas //
	\glc can come-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} today //
	\glft `I can't come today.' //
\endgl\xe

Most of the information the VP contains in this example is marked on the 
content verb, \xayr{sh/}{saha-}{come}, except for ability, which is expressed 
by the particle \xayr{miNF}{ming}{can}. \rayr{miNF}{ming} is an uninflected form 
of the verb expressing ability and may be counted as an auxiliary verb in 
that the full semantic content of the VP is spread out over two verb forms, 
one major, one minor.\footnote{\rayr{mN}{manga} has, in fact, a verbal 
counterpart \xayr{mN/}{manga-}{move; remove} as well, which served as the origin 
of both the progressive and the dynamic marker.} Consider also the following 
example in which \rayr{miNF}{ming} is inflected like a regular verb:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya ang~Diyan. //
	\glb Da-ming-ya ang~Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}=Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do that).' //
\endgl\xe
