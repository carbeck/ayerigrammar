\chapter{Morphological typology}
\index{typology!of morphemes|(}

The first chapter dealt with the smallest constituent parts of words---speech 
sounds, which ones there are, and how they assemble into valid words. 
Consequentially, the following chapters will be about the next step up from 
this: morphemes, the atoms of meaning. First we will have a more general look 
at which kinds of morphemes there are, and then look at them more closely by 
part of speech. This chapter on morphological typology will first deal with 
general questions about Ayeri's degree of synthesis, and then will try 
to answer questions about the kinds of processes the various morpheme classes 
carry out in the language.

\section{Typology}

For the largest part, Ayeri is an \emph{agglutinative}\index{agglutination} 
language since it modifies word roots with affixes for the purposes of 
inflection and derivation, and these affixes, in the form of 
suffixes\index{suffixes} more specifically, can be stacked, especially on 
verbs; the average number of morphemes per word is thus greater than 1:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le kondasayāng hemaye pruyya nay napayya kayvay. //
	\glb Le kond-asa-yāng hema-ye-Ø pruy-ya nay napay-ya kayvay //
	\glc \PatTI{} eat-\Hab{}=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} egg-\Pl{}-\Top{} salt-\Loc{} 
		and pepper-\Loc{} without //
	\glft `He always eats his eggs without salt and pepper.' //
\endgl\xe

The verb root \xayr{koMd/}{kond-}{eat} is inflected here for a habitual action 
with the suffix \rayr{/As}{-asa}, and also carries a person-inflection 
clitic,\index{clitics} \rayr{/yaanF}{-yāng}, marking a third person singular 
masculine agent. With the exception of person-inflection clitics, affixes tend 
to encode a single grammatical function. Verbs are not the only part of speech 
that can inflect; nouns and the relativizing conjunction can as well:

\pex
\a\label{ex:letters}\begingl
	\gla Ang mətahanay tamanyeley yeyam. //
	\glb Ang mə-tahan-ay.Ø taman-ye-ley yeyam. //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Pst{}-write=\Fsg{}.\Top{} letter-\Pl{}-\PargI{} 
		\TsgF{}.\Dat{} //
	\glft `I wrote letters to her.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:relative}\begingl
	\gla Le turayāng taman sinā ang ningay tamala vās. //
	\glb Le tura-yāng taman-Ø si-Ø-na ang ning=ay.Ø tamala vās //
	\glc \PatTI{} send=\Tsg{}.\M{}.\Aarg{} letter-\Top{} 
		\Rel{}-\PatTI{}-\Gen{} \AgtT{} tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday 
		\Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `The letter which I told you about yesterday, he sent it.' //
\endgl
\xe

The principle of not conflating several grammatical functions into a single 
suffix can be observed in (\ref{ex:letters}) regarding the word 
\xayr{tmnFyelej}{tamanyeley}{letters}, in which the plural marker 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye} is distinct from the inanimate-patient case marker 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley}. Strictly speaking, the pronoun \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} 
is also composed, namely of the third person feminine base form \rayr{ye}{ye} 
and the dative case marker \rayr{/ymF}{yam}. Example (\ref{ex:relative}) is one 
we have already encountered before (p.~\pageref{doublerel}). Here, the relative 
pronoun, \xayr{sinaa}{sinā}{of/about which} is inflected for genitive case, and 
stress on the usually unstressed last syllable 
suprasegmentally\index{suprasegmental} marks that this form is contracted from 
\rayr{sileyen}{sileyena} (\textit{si-ley-ena}, \Rel{}-\PargI{}-\Gen{}).

So far, we have concentrated on suffixes, but there are a number of 
prefixes\index{prefixes} as well; (\ref{ex:letters}) exhibits the past prefix 
\rayr{m/}{mə-} (which is actually redundant in this case). There are also 
deictic prefixes on nouns, however. In the following example, the clitic 
\xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this-} joins the noun \xayr{pehmF}{peham}{carpet} to indicate a 
specific carpet.

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le no intoyyang eda-peham. //
	\glb Le no int-oy-yang eda-peham-Ø //
	\glc \PatTI{} want buy-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} this=carpet-\Top{} //
	\glft `I do not want to buy this carpet.' //
\endgl\xe

Besides prefixes and suffixes, Ayeri also possesses at least one grammatical 
morpheme of the kind \citet{zwicky1977} calls a `bound word'.\index{bound 
words} These are cases where morphemes which are

\blockcquote[6]{zwicky1977}{always bound and always unaccented show considerable 
syntactic freedom, in the sense that they can be associated with words of a 
variety of morphosyntactic categories. Frequently, such a \emph{bound word} is 
semantically associated with an entire consituent while being phonologically 
attached to one word of this constituent, and ordinarily the bound word is 
located at the very margins of the word, standing outside even inflectional 
affixes.}

This is the case with the marker \rayr{mN}{manga}, which is treated as an 
independent word, but can modify verbs and prepositions---heads of VPs and 
PPs, respectively---is unstressed and appears at the margin of its 
modification target:

\pex
\a\label{ex:prog}\begingl
	\gla Ang manga yavaya ayon bariley. //
	\glb Ang manga yava-ya ayon-Ø bari-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Prog{} roast-\TsgM{} man-\Top{} meat-\PargI{} //
	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:dyn}\begingl
	\gla Ya mətapyyāng maritay misley manga luga bari. //
	\glb Ya mə-tapy-yāng maritay mis-ley manga luga bari-Ø //
	\glc \LocT{} \Pst{}-put=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} before spit-\PargI{} \Dyn{} 
		between meat-\Top{} //
	\glft `The meat, he had put a spit through it before.' //
\endgl

\xe

In (\ref{ex:prog}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the verb \xayr{yv/}{yava-}{roast} 
and indicates that this is a temporarily ongoing action, like the English 
progressive, except not as strongly grammaticalized.\footnote{I suppose, a 
better parallel is the so-called \fw{rheinische Verlaufsform} `Ripuarian 
progressive' (\fw{sein} `be' + \fw{am/beim} `at the' + infinitive) in German, a 
construction common in the colloquial language which parallels the English 
progressive construction and is not yet fully grammaticalized 
\citep[435]{dudengram2016}.
% 
% \ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em]\label{ex:ripprog}\begingl
% 	\gla Der Mann ist Fleisch am Braten. //
% 	\glc The man is meat at.the roasting //
% 	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
% \endgl\xe
}
%
In (\ref{ex:dyn}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the preposition, on the other 
hand, to indicate that it is dynamic: \rayr{lug}{luga} by itself means `among, 
between', while its dynamic form \rayr{mN lug}{manga luga} means `through; 
during, while, for'.

As we have seen in the examples above, person suffixes on verbs are single 
morphemes that encode more than one property, for example \rayr{/yeNF}{-yeng} 
encodes the person features third person, feminine, singular, and agent. 
Personal pronouns,\index{pronouns!personal} of which the person clitics on 
verbs are an instance, are the main case of fusion among agglutination in Ayeri, 
although some of the forms, like \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} above, can be 
decomposed into root and suffix without problem.\footnote{Originally, Ayeri's 
personal pronouns were indeed agglutinative as well, so \xayr{yeNF}{yeng}{she} 
used to be \rayr{Iye\_aNF}{iyeang} (\fw{iy-e-ang}, \Tsg{}-\F{}-\Aarg{}). This 
also gives an explanation to \citet{boga2016}'s observation that Ayeri's plural 
pronouns are formed \textcquote[{[}15{]}; `possibly in an even too regular 
way']{boga2016}{[v]ielleicht sogar zu regelmäßig}.}

Perpendicular to the axis isolation–agglutination runs the axis 
analytic–syn\-thetic. On the latter axis, Ayeri scores mostly as 
\emph{synthetic}, since it prefers compactness over spreading a construction 
over several words, though it does not incorporate object NPs, so it is not 
going as far as being poly\-syn\-thetic. It is nonetheless theoretically 
possible, due to suffixation being a prominent pattern, to form foot-long words 
like

\ex\begingl
	\gla da-mətahasongoyyang-ikan //
	\glb da=mə-taha-asa-ong-oy=yang=ikan //
	\glc such=\Pst{}-have-\Hab{}-\Irr{}-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}=much //
	\glft `I would not much used to have had such' //
\endgl\xe

Cases of analytic morphology are compound prepositions as we have seen 
one in 
(\ref{ex:dyn}), but verbs as well show analytic structures not only with the 
progressive marker, but also with modals:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ming sahoyyang dabas. //
	\glb Ming saha-oy-yang dabas //
	\glc can come-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} today //
	\glft `I can't come today.' //
\endgl\xe

Most of the information the VP contains in this example is marked on the 
content verb, \xayr{sh/}{saha-}{come}, except for ability, which is expressed 
by the particle \xayr{miNF}{ming}{can}. \rayr{miNF}{ming} is an uninflected form 
of the verb expressing ability and may be counted as an auxiliary verb in 
that the full semantic content of the VP is spread out over two verb forms, 
one major, one minor.\footnote{\rayr{mN}{manga} has, in fact, a verbal 
counterpart \xayr{mN/}{manga-}{move; remove} as well, which served as the origin 
of both the progressive and the dynamic marker.} Consider also the following 
example in which \rayr{miNF}{ming} is inflected like a regular verb:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya ang~Diyan. //
	\glb Da-ming-ya ang~Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}=Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do it).' //
\endgl\xe

\section{Morphological processes}

\subsection{Prefixation}
\index{prefixes}

Prefixes in Ayeri apply mainly to verbs, but nouns, pronouns, adjectives and 
conjunctions can also appear with them, often in the form of 
proclitics\index{clitics}. With verbs, `true' prefixes---that is, morphemes that 
have been semantically bleached by grammaticalization to the point where they 
only express grammatical functions \citep[157ff.]{lehmann2015} and which 
subcategorize words \citep[117]{klavans1985}---are the tense prefixes marking 
both three degrees of past tense and three degrees of future tense, for example:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang səsarāyn ya~Makapetang. //
	\glb Ang sə-sara-ayn.Ø ya=Makapetang //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Fut{}-go=\Fpl{}.\Top{} \Loc{}=Makapetang //
	\glft `We will go to Makapetang.' //
\endgl\xe

Here, the prefix \rayr{se/}{sə-} marks future tense on the verb, 
\xayr{sr/}{sara-}{go}. The other tense\index{tense} prefixes are \rayr{k/}{kə-} 
(\NPst{}), \rayr{m/}{mə-} (\Pst{}), \rayr{v/}{və-} (\RPst{}), and \rayr{p/}{pa-} 
(\NFut{}) and \rayr{ni/}{ni-} (\RFut{}). Besides this set of prefixes, there are 
also a number of proclitics that can appear with verbs, though not exclusively. 
These are the anaphora \xayr{d/}{da-}{thus, so, such} and the 
reflexive\index{pronouns!reflexive} marker \xayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}{self}:

% \pex
% \a\begingl
\ex\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya ang~Diyan. //
	\glb Da-ming-ya ang~Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}=Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do it).' //
\endgl
% 
% \a\begingl
% 	\gla Da-sahāra seyaraneng. //
% 	\glb Da-saha-ara seyaran-eng //
% 	\glc thus=come-\TsgI{} rain-\AargI{} //
% 	\glft `Here/Thus comes the rain.' //
% \endgl
\xe

\ex~\begingl
	\gla Sitang-kecāng. //
	\glb Sitang-ket-yāng //
	\glc self=wash=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} //
	\glft `He washes \emph{himself}.' //
\endgl\xe

\rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-} can also be used as a preverb in situations where the 
agent is also the instrument, so both of the following two sentences are 
equivalent in meaning:

\pex
\a\label{ex:sitang+pronoun}\begingl
	\gla Sa apicāng nanga ikan sitang-yari. //
	\glb Sa apit-yāng nanga ikan sitang-yari //
	\glc \PatT{} clean=\Tsg{}.\Aarg{} house complete self=\TsgM{}.\Ins{} //
	\glft `He cleaned the whole house by himself.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Sa sitang-apicāng nanga ikan. //
	\glb Sa sitang-apit-yāng nanga ikan //
	\glc \PatT{} self=clean=\Tsg{}.\Aarg{} house complete //
	\glft (idem) //
\endgl
\xe

Example (\ref{ex:sitang+pronoun}) shows the more common application of 
\rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}, that is, as a reflexive modifier of pronouns. The 
prefix \rayr{d/}{da-} can as well be used with noun phrases and is part of the 
demonstrative set of prefixes, \xayr{d/}{da-}{such}, \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, and 
\xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}:

\ex\begingl
	\gla eda-ganang //
	\glb eda-gan-ang //
	\glc this=child-\Aarg{} //
	\glft `this child' //
\endgl\xe

The demonstrative prefixes are also used to form the demonstrative 
pronouns\index{pronouns!demonstrative} \xayr{EdnY}{edanya}{this one}, 
\xayr{AdnY}{adanya}{that one} and \xayr{dnY}{danya}{such a}. A special case is 
this regard is the postposition \xayr{d/naarY}{da-nārya}{in spite of, despite} 
where \rayr{d/}{da-} combines with the conjunction \xayr{naarY}{nārya}{but, 
although, except}. There is also a fixed adverbial expression using one of 
thse prefixes, \xayr{Ed/tdjymF}{eda-tadayyam}{for the time being, for now} 
(this=time-\Dat{}).

Last but not least, the prefix \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as though} can be used 
with both adjectives and nouns (or, more precisely, phrases containing 
nominals):

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla ku-koyaya //
	\glb ku-koya-ya //
	\glc like=book-\Loc{} //
	\glft `like in a book' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla ku-prasi //
	\glb ku=prasi //
	\glft `as though (it were) sour' //
\endgl
\xe

An example of a set-phrase adverbial consisting of \rayr{ku/}{ku-} and a verb 
is \xayr{ku/nsY}{ku-nasya}{as follows}, \rayr{nsY/}{nasy-} meaning `follow'. 
What is curious here is that this fossilized form is lacking person marking 
and is just extended with an epenthetic \textit{-a} since \textit{-sy} is not 
a permissible coda. The expected form would be 
*\,\rayr{ku/nsYreNF}{*ku-nasyareng} (like=follow=\TsgI{}.\Aarg{}).

Following \citet{klavans1985}, who suggests that clitics best be defined as 
\textcquote[117]{klavans1985}[,]{affixation at the phrasal level} a very common 
kind of clitical prefix to the verb \emph{phrase} are the topic markers. They 
are counted as parts of the VP but do not interact with it regarding stress 
assignment (they are always unstressed) while always being in an initial 
position, preceding any other preverbal elements:

\pex
	\a\begingl
		\gla Ang tahanya tamanley. //
		\glb Ang tahan-ya taman-ley //
		\glc \AgtT{} write-\TsgM{} letter-\PargI{} //
		\glft `He writes a letter.' //
	\endgl
	\a \textit{Ang mətahanya tamanley.} `He wrote a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga mətahanya tamanley.} `He was writing a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga no mətahanya tamanley.} `He was wanting to write a 
		letter.'
\xe
