\chapter{Morphological typology}
\index{typology!of morphemes|(}

The first chapter dealt with the smallest constituent parts of words---speech 
sounds, which ones there are, and how they assemble into valid words. 
Consequently, the following two chapters will be about the next step up from 
this: morphemes, the atoms of meaning. First we will have a more general look 
at which kinds of morphemes there are, and then look at them more closely by 
part of speech: what is their distribution, and how are morphemes put together 
to form inflected words? This chapter on morphological typology will first 
deal with general questions about Ayeri's degree of synthesis, and then will
try to answer questions about the kinds of functions the various morpheme
classes carry out in the language.

\section{Typology}
\label{sec:typology}

For the largest part, Ayeri is an \emph{agglutinative}\index{agglutination} 
language. \citet{comrie1989} says of agglutinating languages that in these, 
typically,

\blockcquote[43--44]{comrie1989}{a word may consist of more than one morpheme,
but the boundaries between morphemes in the word are always clear-cut;
moreover, a given morpheme has at least a reasonably invariant shape, so that
the identification of morphemes in terms of their phonetic shape is also
straightforward. […] As is suggested by the term agglutinating (cf. Latin
\fw{gluten} `glue'), it is as if the various affixes were just glued on one 
after the other (or one before the other, with prefixes).}

In Ayeri, root morphemes are modified by affixes for the purposes of inflection
and derivation, and these affixes, in the form of suffixes\index{suffixes} more
specifically, can be stacked, especially on verbs. Indeed, they vary little, so
that they are always easily recognizable. Suffixation in Ayeri is especially
prominent on verbs:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le kondasayāng hemaye pruyya nay napayya kayvay. //
	\glb Le kond-asa=yāng hema-ye-Ø pruy-ya nay napay-ya kayvay //
	\glc \PatTI{} eat-\Hab{}=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} egg-\Pl{}-\Top{} salt-\Loc{} 
		and pepper-\Loc{} without //
	\glft `He always eats his eggs without salt and pepper.' //
\endgl\xe

The verb root \xayr{koMd/}{kond-}{eat} is inflected here for a habitual action
with the suffix \rayr{/As}{-asa}, and also carries a person-inflection
clitic,\index{clitics} \rayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}, marking a third person singular
masculine agent. With the notable exception of pronouns and related person-
inflection clitics, affixes tend to encode a single grammatical function. Verbs
are not the only part of speech that can inflect; nouns and the relativizing
conjunction can as well:

\pex
\a\label{ex:letters}\begingl
	\gla Ang mətahanay tamanyeley yeyam. //
	\glb Ang mə-tahan=ay.Ø taman-ye-ley yeyam. //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Pst{}-write=\Fsg{}.\Top{} letter-\Pl{}-\PargI{} 
		\TsgF{}.\Dat{} //
	\glft `I wrote letters to her.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:relative}\begingl
	\gla Le turayāng taman sinā ang ningay tamala vās. //
	\glb Le tura=yāng taman-Ø si-Ø-na ang ning=ay.Ø tamala vās //
	\glc \PatTI{} send=\Tsg{}.\M{}.\Aarg{} letter-\Top{} 
		\Rel{}-\PatTI{}-\Gen{} \AgtT{} tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday 
		\Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `The letter which I told you about yesterday, he sent it.' //
\endgl
\xe

The principle of not conflating several grammatical functions into a single
suffix can be observed in (\ref{ex:letters}) regarding the word
\xayr{tmnFyelej}{tamanyeley}{letters}, in which the plural marker 
\rayr{/ye}{-ye} is distinct from the inanimate-patient case marker 
\rayr{/lej}{-ley} (the latter, however, conflates animacy and case). Strictly 
speaking, the pronoun \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} is also composed, namely of
the third person feminine base form \rayr{ye}{ye} and the dative case marker
\rayr{/ymF}{yam}. Example (\ref{ex:relative}) is one we have already 
encountered before (p.~\pageref{doublerel}). Here, the relative pronoun,
\xayr{sinaa}{sinā}{of/about which} is inflected for genitive case, and 
stress on the usually unstressed last syllable
suprasegmentally\index{suprasegmental} marks that this form is contracted from
\rayr{sileyen}{sileyena} (\textit{si-ley-ena}, \Rel{}-\PargI{}-\Gen{}).

So far, we have concentrated on suffixes, but there are a number of 
prefixes\index{prefixes} as well; (\ref{ex:letters}) exhibits the past prefix 
\rayr{m/}{mə-} (which is actually redundant in this case). There are also 
demonstrative prefixes on nouns, however. In the following example, the prefix 
\xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this-} joins the noun \xayr{pehmF}{peham}{carpet} to indicate 
a specific carpet.

\ex\begingl
	\gla Le no intoyyang eda-peham. //
	\glb Le no int-oy=yang eda=peham-Ø //
	\glc \PatTI{} want buy-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} this=carpet-\Top{} //
	\glft `I do not want to buy this carpet.' //
\endgl\xe

% FIXME: 'Bound word' very problematic, see Spencer & Luís 2012: 42ff. Manga 
% might be best analyzed as inflection (or a non-projecting word?), actually!
Besides prefixes and suffixes, Ayeri also possesses at least one grammatical 
morpheme of the kind \citet{zwicky1977} calls a `bound word'.\index{bound 
words} Bound words are cases where morphemes which are

\blockcquote[6]{zwicky1977}{always bound and always unaccented show
considerable syntactic freedom, in the sense that they can be associated with
words of a variety of morphosyntactic categories. Frequently, such a
\emph{bound word} is semantically associated with an entire consituent while
being phonologically attached to one word of this constituent, and ordinarily
the bound word is located at the very margins of the word, standing outside
even inflectional affixes.}

This is the case with the marker \rayr{mN}{manga}, which is treated as an
independent word, but can modify verbs and prepositions---heads of verb phrases
(VPs) and prepositional phrases (PPs), respectively---is unstressed and appears
at the margin of its modification target:

\pex
\a\label{ex:prog}\begingl
	\gla Ang manga yavaya ayon bariley. //
	\glb Ang manga yava-ya ayon-Ø bari-ley //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Prog{} roast-\TsgM{} man-\Top{} meat-\PargI{} //
	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:dyn}\begingl
	\gla Ya mətapyyāng maritay misley manga luga bari. //
	\glb Ya mə-tapy=yāng maritay mis-ley manga luga bari-Ø //
	\glc \LocT{} \Pst{}-put=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} before spit-\PargI{} \Dyn{} 
		between meat-\Top{} //
	\glft `The meat, he had put a spit through it before.' //
\endgl

\xe

In (\ref{ex:prog}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the verb \xayr{yv/}{yava-}{roast} 
and indicates that this is a temporarily ongoing action, like the English
progressive, except not as strongly grammaticalized.\footnote{I suppose, a
better parallel is the so-called \fw{rheinische Verlaufsform} `Ripuarian
progressive' (\fw{sein} `be' + \fw{am/beim} `at the' + infinitive) in German, a
construction common in the colloquial language which parallels the English
progressive construction and is not yet fully grammaticalized
\citep[435]{dudengram2016}. Speakers will thus accept both \fw{Er lernt 
gerade}, literally `He studies right now', and \fw{Er ist am Lernen} `He is
studying'.
% 
% \ex[lingstyle=fnex,belowexskip=-1em]\label{ex:ripprog}\begingl
% 	\gla Der Mann ist Fleisch am Braten. //
% 	\glc The man is meat at.the roasting //
% 	\glft `The man is roasting meat.' //
% \endgl\xe
}
%
In (\ref{ex:dyn}), \rayr{mN}{manga} modifies the preposition, on the other 
hand, to indicate that it is dynamic: \rayr{lug}{luga} by itself means `among, 
between', while its dynamic form \rayr{mN lug}{manga luga} means `through; 
during, for'.

As we have seen in the examples above, person suffixes on verbs are single 
morphemes that encode more than one property, for example \rayr{/yeNF}{-yeng} 
encodes the person features third person, feminine, singular, and agent. 
Personal pronouns,\index{pronouns!personal} of which the person clitics on 
verbs are an instance, are the main case of fusion among agglutination in 
Ayeri, although some of the forms, like \xayr{yeymF}{yeyam}{to her} above, can 
be decomposed into root and suffix without problem.\footnote{Originally, 
Ayeri's personal pronouns were indeed agglutinative as well, so 
\xayr{yeNF}{yeng}{she} used to be \rayr{Iye\_aNF}{iyeang} (\fw{iy-e-ang}, 
\Tsg{}-\F{}-\Aarg{}). This also gives an explanation to \citet{boga2016}'s 
observation that Ayeri's plural pronouns are formed \textcquote[{[}15{]}; 
`possibly in an even too regular way']{boga2016}{[v]ielleicht sogar zu 
regelmäßig}.}

Perpendicular to the axis isolation–agglutination runs the axis 
analytic–syn\-thetic. On the latter axis, Ayeri scores mostly as 
\emph{synthetic}, since it prefers compactness over spreading a construction 
over several words, though it does not incorporate object noun phrases (NPs) 
and it is not possible to form `sentence-words' either, so it is not going so 
far as to be poly\-syn\-thetic \citep[45--46]{comrie1989}. It is nonetheless 
theoretically possible, due to suffixation being a prominent pattern, to form 
foot-long words like

\ex\label{ex:footlong}\begingl
	\gla da-mətahasongoyyang-ikan //
	\glb da=mə-taha-asa-ong-oy=yang=ikan //
	\glc such=\Pst{}-have-\Hab{}-\Irr{}-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}=much //
	\glft `I would not much used to have had such' //
\endgl\xe

Cases of analytic morphology are compound prepositions as we have seen 
with \xayr{mN lug}{manga luga}{through} in (\ref{ex:dyn}), but verbs as well 
show analytic structures not only with the progressive marker, but also with 
modals:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ming sahoyyang dabas. //
	\glb Ming saha-oy=yang dabas //
	\glc can come-\Neg{}=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} today //
	\glft `I can't come today.' //
\endgl\xe

Most of the information the VP contains in this example is marked on the
content verb, \xayr{sh/}{saha-}{come}, except for ability, which is expressed
by the particle \xayr{miNF}{ming}{can}. \rayr{miNF}{ming} is an uninflected
form of the verb expressing ability and may be counted as an auxiliary verb in
that the full semantic content of the VP is spread out over two verb forms, one
major, one minor---this probably should not be understood as a serial verb
construction, however \citep{aikhenvald2006}.%
\footnote{\rayr{mN}{manga} has, in fact, a verbal counterpart 
\xayr{mN/}{manga-}{move; remove} as well, which presumably served as the 
origin of both the progressive and the dynamic marker.\label{fn:mangaverb}}
Consider also the following example in which \rayr{miNF}{ming} is inflected
like a regular verb:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya {ang Diyan}. //
	\glb Da=ming-ya ang=Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}=Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do it).' //
\endgl\xe

\section{Morphological processes}

\subsection{Prefixation}
\index{prefixes|(}

Prefixes in Ayeri apply mainly to verbs, but nouns, pronouns, adjectives and
conjunctions as well can appear with them, some of which may be clitics;
reasons for their being clitics will be given at the appropriate cases in the
sections on the various parts of speech. With verbs, prefixes that are most
certainly `true' prefixes---that is, morphemes that have been semantically
bleached by grammaticalization to the point where they only express grammatical
functions \citep[157ff.]{lehmann2015} and which subcategorize words rather than
phrases \citep[117]{klavans1985}---are the tense prefixes marking both three
degrees of past and future tense, for example:

\ex\begingl
	\gla Ang səsarāyn {ya Makapetang}. //
	\glb Ang sə-sara=ayn.Ø ya=Makapetang //
	\glc \AgtT{} \Fut{}-go=\Fpl{}.\Top{} \Loc{}=Makapetang //
	\glft `We will go to Makapetang.' //
\endgl\xe

Here, the prefix \rayr{se/}{sə-} marks future tense on the verb, 
\xayr{sr/}{sara-}{go}. The other tense\index{tense} prefixes are \rayr{k/}{kə-} 
(\NPst{}), \rayr{m/}{mə-} (\Pst{}), \rayr{v/}{və-} (\RPst{}), and 
\rayr{p/}{pa-} (\NFut{}) and \rayr{ni/}{ni-} (\RFut{}). Besides this set of 
prefixes, there are also a number of proclitics that can appear with verbs, 
though not exclusively. These are the anaphora \xayr{d/}{da-}{thus, so, such} 
and the reflexive\index{pronouns!reflexive} marker \xayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}{self}:
 
% \pex
% \a\begingl
\ex\begingl
	\gla Da-mingya {ang Diyan}. //
	\glb Da=ming-ya ang=Diyan. //
	\glc so=can-\TsgM{} \Aarg{}=Diyan //
	\glft `Diyan can (do it).' //
\endgl
% 
% \a\begingl
% 	\gla Da-sahāra seyaraneng. //
% 	\glb Da=saha-ara seyaran-eng //
% 	\glc thus=come-\TsgI{} rain-\AargI{} //
% 	\glft `Here/Thus comes the rain.' //
% \endgl
\xe

\ex~\begingl
	\gla Sitang-kecāng. //
	\glb Sitang=ket=yāng //
	\glc \Refl{}=wash=\TsgM{}.\Aarg{} //
	\glft `He washes \emph{himself}.' //
\endgl\xe

\rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-} can also be used as a preverb in situations where the 
agent is also the instrument, so both of the following two sentences are 
equivalent in meaning:

\pex
\a\label{ex:sitang+pronoun}\begingl
	\gla Sa apicāng nanga ikan sitang-yari. //
	\glb Sa apit=yāng nanga ikan sitang=yari //
	\glc \PatT{} clean=\Tsg{}.\Aarg{} house complete 
		\Refl{}=\TsgM{}.\Ins{} //
	\glft `He cleaned the whole house by himself.' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla Sa sitang-apicāng nanga ikan. //
	\glb Sa sitang=apit=yāng nanga ikan //
	\glc \PatT{} \Refl{}=clean=\Tsg{}.\Aarg{} house complete //
	\glft (idem) //
\endgl
\xe

\phantomsection\label{nounprefixes}
Example (\ref{ex:sitang+pronoun}) shows the more common application of 
\rayr{sitNF/}{sitang-}, that is, as a reflexive modifier of pronouns. The 
prefix \rayr{d/}{da-} can as well be used with noun phrases and is part of the 
demonstrative set of prefixes, \xayr{d/}{da-}{such}, \xayr{Ed/}{eda-}{this}, 
and \xayr{Ad/}{ada-}{that}:

\ex\begingl
	\gla eda-ganang //
	\glb eda=gan-ang //
	\glc this=child-\Aarg{} //
	\glft `this child' //
\endgl\xe

The demonstrative prefixes are also used to form the demonstrative 
pronouns\index{pronouns!demonstrative} \xayr{EdnY}{edanya}{this one}, 
\xayr{AdnY}{adanya}{that one} and \xayr{dnY}{danya}{such one}. A special case 
in this regard is the postposition \xayr{d/naarY}{da-nārya}{in spite of, 
despite} where \rayr{d/}{da-} combines with the conjunction 
\xayr{naarY}{nārya}{but, although, except}. Originally, 
\xayr{dikpis}{dikapisa}{respective} is derived from \rayr{d/}{da-} + 
\xayr{Ikpis}{ikapisa}{bound, dependent}, which is an example of a combination 
with an adjective. There is also a fixed adverbial expression using one of 
these prefixes, \xayr{Ed/tdjymF}{eda-tadayyam}{for the time being, for now} 
(this=time-\Dat{}).

Last but not least, the prefix \xayr{ku/}{ku-}{like, as though} can be used 
with both adjectives and nouns (or, more precisely, phrases containing 
nominals):

\pex
\a\begingl
	\gla ku-koyaya //
	\glb ku=koya-ya //
	\glc like=book-\Loc{} //
	\glft `like in a book' //
\endgl

\a\begingl
	\gla ku-prasi //
	\glb ku=prasi //
	\glc like=sour //
	\glft `as though (it were) sour' //
\endgl
\xe

An example of a set-phrase adverbial consisting of \rayr{ku/}{ku-} and a verb 
is \xayr{ku/nsY}{ku-nasya}{as follows}, \rayr{nsY/}{nasy-} meaning `follow'. 
What is curious here is that this fossilized form is lacking person marking 
and is just extended with an epenthetic \textit{-a} since \textit{-sy} is not 
a permissible coda. The expected form would be 
*\rayr{ku/nsYreNF}{*ku-nasyareng} (like=follow=\TsgI{}.\Aarg{}).

Following \citet{klavans1985}, who suggests that clitics best be defined as
\textcquote[117]{klavans1985}{affixation at the phrasal level}, a very common 
kind of prefix to the verb \emph{phrase} are the topic markers. They are
counted as parts of the VP but do not interact with it regarding stress
assignment (they are always unstressed) while always being in an initial
position, preceding any other preverbal elements:

\pex
	\a\begingl
		\gla Ang tahanya tamanley. //
		\glb Ang tahan-ya taman-ley //
		\glc \AgtT{} write-\TsgM{} letter-\PargI{} //
		\glft `He writes a letter.' //
	\endgl
	\a \textit{Ang mətahanya tamanley.} `He wrote a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga mətahanya tamanley.} `He was writing a letter.'
	\a \textit{Ang manga no mətahanya tamanley.} `He was wanting to write a 
		letter.'
\xe

\index{prefixes|)}

\subsection{Suffixation}
\index{suffixes|(}

As a largely agglutinative language, most grammatical marking in Ayeri is done
by means of suffixes. These occur mainly with nouns and verbs, however,
quantifiers take the shape of suffixes as well. Quantifiers, then, may modify
content words almost regardless of their part of speech---noun, verb, adjective
or adverb. The most pervasive examples of suffixation are certainly those of
case marking on nouns and of person marking on verbs, for example:

\ex\label{ex:conjdecl}\begingl
	\gla Sa pəharuyang va manga miday tangya vana suyareri, vimyon! //
	\glb Sa pə-haru=yang va.Ø manga miday tang-ya vana suyar-eri, vimyon //
	\glc \PatT{} \NFut{}-beat=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{} \Ssg{}.\Top{} \Dyn{} around 
		ears-\Loc{} \Ssg{}.\Gen{} ladle-\Ins{}, monkey! //
	\glft `I'll beat you around your ears with a ladle, you monkey!' //
\endgl\xe

This example shows marking of \xayr{tNF}{tang}{ears} with the locative case
suffix \rayr{/y}{-ya} and the marking of \xayr{suyrF}{suyar}{ladle} with the
instrumental case suffix \rayr{/Eri}{-eri}; the previous examples already
provide instances of the exceedingly common markers for agent and patient case,
\rayr{/ANF}{-ang} and \rayr{/AsF}{-as}, respectively. Besides case, nouns can
also be marked for plural with the suffix \rayr{/ye}{-ye}, and verb roots may
be extended by the mood and aspect markers \rayr{/ONF}{-ong} (\Irr{}),
\rayr{/As}{-asa} (\Hab{}) and \rayr{/Oj}{-oy} (\Neg{}), the last of which is 
the most frequently occurring one. The mood suffixes can also be stacked,
leading to the long word in (\ref{ex:footlong}) above. Person marking on verbs
is realized as agreement suffixes or of clitic personal pronouns depending on
whether an agent NP proper is present or not for the verb to agree with. In
(\ref{ex:conjdecl}), a cliticized agent pronoun \xayr{/yaaNF}{-yāng}{he}
(\TsgM{}.\Aarg{}) appears.

As mentioned above, quantifiers appear as enclitics on almost any type of 
content word, like on the adverb \xayr{pr}{para}{fast} in the following example:

\ex
%\pex
% \a\begingl
% 	%\glpreamble With a verb: //
% 	\gla No sarayang-ikan //
% 	\glb No sara=yang=ikan //
% 	\glc want go=\Fsg{}.\Aarg{}=much //
% 	\glft `I really want to go.' //
% \endgl
%\a
\begingl
	%\glpreamble With an adverb: //
	\gla Tigalyeng para-ma. //
	\glb Tigal=yeng para=ma //
	\glc swim=\TsgF{}.\Aarg{} fast=enough //
	\glft `She swims fast enough.' //
\endgl

% \a\begingl

% 	\glb Yang valuy=eng, saha=vāng. //

% 	\glft `I am rather glad that you come.' //
% \endgl
%

% 	\glft `It was such a happy day.' //
% \endgl
% 
% \a\begingl
% 	%\glpreamble With a noun: //

% 	\glft `They did not eat any soup at all.' //
% \endgl

\xe

\index{suffixes|)}

\subsection{Reduplication}
\label{subsec:reduplication}
\index{reduplication|(}

There are two patterns of reduplication for verbs, one with complete
reduplication of the imperative form to create a hortative statement
(\ref{ex:hort}), and one with partial reduplication as a way to express that an
action takes place again, that is, partial reduplication expresses a iterative,
as it were (\ref{ex:iter}). The imperative iterative, then, has a hortative
function as well (\ref{ex:hort+iter}):

\pex
\a\label{ex:hort}\begingl%
	\gla naru-naru //
	\glb naru\til{}nara-u //
	\glc \Hort{}\til{}speak-\Imp{} //
	\glft `let us speak' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:iter}\begingl
	\gla na-narayeng //
	\glb na\til{}nara=yeng //
	\glc \Iter{}\til{}speak=\TsgF{}.\Aarg{} //
	\glft `she speaks again' //
\endgl

\a\label{ex:hort+iter}\begingl
	\gla na-naru //
	\glb na\til{}nara-u //
	\glc \Iter{}\til{}speak-\Imp{} //
	\glft `let us speak again' //
\endgl

\xe

With nouns, full reduplication is used to create a diminutive\index{diminutive}
form (\ref{ex:regdim}), though some reduplications are also lexicalized and may
use roots from other parts of speech as well to form nouns, for instance, the
words in (\ref{ex:otherredupnn}--\hyperref[ex:otherredupvb]{d}). There are also
a number of adjectives for which there exists a lexical reduplication with an
intensifying meaning; (\ref{ex:adjredup}) lists a few examples. This, however,
is not a productive derivation strategy.

\pex
	\a \makebox[10.5em][l]{\xayr{\larger venej}{veney}{dog}}
		→ \xayr{\larger venej/venej}{veney-veney}{little dog, 
			doggie}\label{ex:regdim}

As written above (\autoref{doublerel}), case agreement on a complex-marked 
relative pronoun\index{pronouns!relative} can drop out under certain 
circumstances and is replaced by compensatory stress on the secondary case 
marker, which lengthens the syllable's nucleus vowel:

\ex\begingl

		tell=\Fsg{}.\Top{} yesterday \Ssg{}.\Parg{} //
	\glft `… the letter which (*whose) I told you about yesterday' //
\endgl\xe

This can be reinterpreted so that vowel length/stress itself is what signifies 
the agreement of the relativizer with the preceding NP. Which grammatical role 
the relativizer's head instantiates as an agreement controller is essentially 
underspecified, hence I will gloss it as -\Agr{} in the following example 
instead of as full -\PargI{}:

\ex[everygla=\upshape]\begingl
	\gla /ˌsi.leɪ.ˈena/ → /si.ˈna(ː)/ //
	\glb /si-leɪ-ena/ → /si-ˈ-na(ː)/ //
	\glc \Rel{}-\PargI{}-\Gen{} {} \Rel{}-\Agr{}-\Gen{} //
\endgl\xe

Since \rayr{n}{na} as a light syllable cannot be stressed in word-final 
position under normal circumstances, it has to lengthen to \rayr{naa}{nā}.

% \subsection{Clitics}
% 
% I have used the term `clitic' above and claimed that various bound morphemes 
% belong to this category. However, this term is notoriously vague and thus needs 
% some specification and formalization as to why certain morphemes in Ayeri are 
% probably best categorized as clitics rather than words or affixes. After the 
% publication of \citeauthor{zwicky1977}'s preliminary thoughts on the topic 
% \citep{zwicky1977}, a number of articles were published that tried to provide a 
% formal definition of what constitutes a clitic. \citet{zwicky1985} and 
% \citet{klavans1985} provide guidelines for determining whether a given element 
% which is suspected to be a clitic should better be categorized as a `particle' 
% word or as a suffix, or whether it is indeed an in-between thing, and thus a 
% clitic. \autoref{tab:clitichood} lists a catalog of 
% \textcquote[285]{zwicky1985}{symptoms} that is supposed to serve as a 
% heuristic in determining the status of the various bound morphemes listed at 
% the top and tries to categorize them by keeping score:
% 
% \begin{longtabu} to .75\linewidth {X[1r] X[6l]}
% 0 & `does not apply',\\
% 0.5 & `applies under certain circumstances', and\\
% 1 & `applies'.\\
% \end{longtabu}\addtocounter{table}{-1}
% 
% The table mostly contains `1' in the various fields, insofar most of the given 
% criteria for clitichood are met. Thus, the few places in which `0' or `0.5' 
% appear demand further discussion, as do the cases where the difference 
% quotient indicates a narrow decision. A `0' answer is also interesting as it 
% means that the morpheme is behaving uncharacteristically of clitics for the 
% respective criterion.

\section{Marking strategies}
\label{sec:markstrat}
\index{marking strategies}
\index{dependent marking}

With regards to the dichotomy head--dependent marking, Ayeri is rather  
thoroughly dependent marking, albeit with the exception of agreement 
morphology on the verb. Dependent marking is exhibited, for instance, in the 
expression of possessive relationships, where the dependent is marked for 
genitive case\index{cases!genitive}:

	\glc basket meat-\Ins{} \Fsg{}.\textbf{\Gen{}} //
	\glft `my basket of meat' //
\endgl

\xe
\end{multicols}

In (\ref{ex:gennoun}), \rayr{tuvo}{Tuvo} is grammatically in possession of her 
\xayr{dem}{dema}{aunt}; the possessee forms the head of the phrase while it is 
modified by the possessor, which receives the marking. In (\ref{ex:genprn}), 
\xayr{ksu}{kasu}{basket} forms the head and thus also the possessee while 
\xayr{naa}{nā}{my} serves as the dependent possessor; the genitive case is, 
then again, marked on the dependent. A further example of dependent marking is 
the locative case, which is marked on the prepositional object while the 
preposition itself, as the head of the PP, does not receive marking:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\ex\label{ex:loc}
\begingl
	\gla agonan minkay\textbf{ya} //
	\glb agonan minkay\textbf{-ya} //

\end{multicols}

The relativizer, likewise, may agree in case with the NP in the matrix clause
to which it links the relative clause. This typically happens mainly in formal
language and---in terms of linear succession of words at the surface level of
the clause---if the relativizer cannot be immediately adjacent to the NP which
the relative clause modifies, for example, when an adjective or a possessive
pronoun is following the noun:

%\begin{minipage}[t][11em][t]{\linewidth}

The only instance of head-marking there is in Ayeri is person-marking on the
verb, which manifests when the NP following the verb (agent or patient) is not
pronominal and thus there is no pronoun to cliticize to the verb stem, but the
verb still receives a suffix that indicates a relation with, usually, the agent
NP:

\begin{multicols}{2}
\ex\begingl
	\gla Mal\textbf{ya} {ang Amān}. //
	\glb Mal\textbf{-ya} ang=Amān //
	\glc sing\textbf{-\TsgM{}} \Aarg{}=Amān //

\node (label) at ($(B)!0.5!(C)$) [below] {\tiny\itshape person agreement};
\end{forest}

\end{multicols}

Sentences containing more than one NP also have topic marking on the verb, so 
that the verb agrees with one of the NPs in topicality. This may be the NP it 
has person agreement with or any other NP. The topicalized NP as a dependent 
of the verb is, in turn, zero-marked, so that the marking relationship for 
topics is bilateral and thus mixed:

\begin{multicols}{2}

\node (label) at ($(B)!0.5!(C)$) [below] {\tiny\itshape topic agreement};
\end{forest}

\end{multicols}

In this example, the verb exhibits canonic agreement with the agent, 
\rayr{AgYaanF}{Ajān}, in person, gender, and number. It is additionally marked 
for a patient topic, \rayr{pil}{Pila}, and thus serves as an agreement target 
for two different controller NPs. The agreement relation is of a different kind
for each of the two NPs, however.
