A Grammar of Ayeri
==================

This is a renewed effort to revise and expand on what's currently on the web as the *Ayeri Grammar* ([PDF](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8026017/Ayeri%20grammar/grammar.pdf)), started in July 2016. I hope that by transferring things to LaTeX, the whole process of editing will become more easy to handle than when I was trying to work with one big document in LibreOffice before.
