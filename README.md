A Grammar of Ayeri
==================

This is a renewed effort, started in July 2016, to revise and to expand on what can be found on the internet as _A Grammar of Ayeri_ ([PDF, January 2011](https://rawgit.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/master/misc/ayeri_grammar_2011.pdf)).

I had been leaving this earlier documentation attempt in a very sorry and unfinished state for over 5 years before finally returning to it, prompted by a [class on constructed languages](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~abuch/16ss/conlang.html) at the University of Tübingen in the summer semester of 2016, which used Ayeri as one of its objects of study. I hope that by using LaTeX and GitHub, the whole process of editing will be more easy to handle and more transparent than when I was trying to work with one big LibreOffice document before. If you feel inclined to do so, you can report issues on the [repository page](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar).

Ayeri is a fictional language which I have been developing since December 2003. Work on this project basically serves as a creative outlet to my ongoing interest in linguistics.

Currently working on
====================

**WARNING**: This is work heavily in progress! Things may still be a little rough around the edges, especially the parts currently being worked on:

* Phrase structures (`chapters/syntax.tex`)
    1. Noun and determiner phrases
    2. Adjective and adverb phrases
    3. Adpositional phrases
    4. Inflectional and verb phrases

The [sections not currently worked on](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar#table-of-contents) have been proofread at least once, by myself. They should already provide useful information, however, I may still make changes occasionally if I notice something to be wrong or information to be missing. Note that I am not a native English speaker; corrections are thus welcome. If you're brave, you can take a look at the [most recently compiled PDF](https://rawgit.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/master/grammar.pdf) (see the [file's history](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/commits/master/grammar.pdf)).

I will tag a release (basically "first edition") only when everything is as complete as I can get it for the moment. Notably, the section on syntax—discussing the various constituent types (NP, VP, PP, ...) and how to put them together to form valid sentences—is incomplete so far, since my approach is to go from the smallest to the largest units.

Table of Contents
=================

The table of contents encompasses the following topics so far; the LaTeX source files for each chapter are given in brackets.

1. Phonology (`chapters/phonology.tex`)
   1. Phoneme Inventory
   2. Phonotactics
   3. Notes on Prosody
2. Writing System (`chapters/writing.tex`)
3. Morphological Typology (`chapters/morphtyp.tex`)
4. Grammatical Categories (`chapters/gramcat.tex`)
   1. Nouns
   2. Pronouns
   3. Adjectives
   4. Adpositions
   5. Verbs
   6. Adverbs
   7. Numerals
   8. Conjunctions

Compiling
=========

Compile `grammar.tex` with `xelatex`, `biber`, `makeindex` and `makeglossaries`, or use `arara grammar` to do all the required steps automatically. A standard TeXLive 2015 installation should bring all package dependencies, with the notable exception of the `avm` package, which you may have to download from [Christopher Manning's website](http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/tex/) and unzip somewhere in LaTeX's `PATH` (e.g. `~/texmf/tex/latex`). Fonts used:

* Body text: [Junicode](http://junicode.sourceforge.net/)
* Captions, Headings: [Fira Sans](https://carrois.com/typefaces/FiraSans/)
* Examples: [Tagati Book G](https://github.com/carbeck/tagatibookg)
* Other:
  * [DejaVu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/)
  * [Free Serif](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/)
  * [Tuladha Jejeg](https://sites.google.com/site/jawaunicode/main-page)
