A Grammar of Ayeri
==================

This is a renewed effort, started in July 2016, to revise and to expand on what can be found on the internet as _A Grammar of Ayeri_ ([PDF, January 2011](https://rawgit.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/master/misc/ayeri_grammar_2011.pdf)). You can also take a look at the [most recently compiled PDF of the current working draft](https://rawgit.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/master/grammar.pdf) (see the [file's history](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/commits/master/grammar.pdf)). Ayeri is a fictional language (a "conlang") which I have been developing since December 2003. Work on this project basically serves as a creative outlet to my ongoing interest in linguistics.

I had been leaving the earlier grammar document in a very sorry and unfinished state for over 5 years before finally returning to it, prompted by a [class on constructed languages](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/~abuch/16ss/conlang.html) at the University of Tübingen in the summer semester of 2016, which used Ayeri as one of its objects of study. The work presented here is mostly a complete rewrite of the old grammar sketch from scratch, not merely an extention.

I hope that by using LaTeX and GitHub, the whole process of editing will be more easy to handle and more transparent than when I was trying to work with one big LibreOffice document before. If you feel inclined to do so, you can [report issues on Github](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar/issues).

Currently working on
====================

**WARNING**: This is work heavily in progress! The following part(s) are currently being proofread for a second time:

* Phonology (`chapters/phonology.tex`)
   1. Phoneme Inventory
   2. Phonotactics
   3. Notes on Prosody
* Writing System (`chapters/writing.tex`)

The [sections not currently worked on](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar#table-of-contents) have been proofread at least once, by myself. They should already provide useful information, however, I may still make changes if I notice something to be wrong or information to be missing or inconsistent. Note that I am not a native English speaker; corrections are thus welcome.

I will tag a release (basically "first edition") only when everything is as complete as I can get it for the moment.

Roadmap
=======

* proofread and correct *whole* thing again
* maybe extend name list with etymologies
* make index
* look into print-on-demand options

Compiling
=========

Compile `grammar.tex` with `xelatex`, `biber`, `makeindex` and `makeglossaries`, or use `arara grammar` to do all the required steps automatically. A standard TeXLive 2015 installation should bring all package dependencies, with the notable exception of the `avm` package, which you may have to download from [Christopher Manning's website](http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/tex/) and unzip somewhere in LaTeX's `PATH` (e.g. `~/texmf/tex/latex`). Fonts used:

* Body text: [Junicode](http://junicode.sourceforge.net/)
* Captions, Headings: [Fira Sans](https://carrois.com/typefaces/FiraSans/)
* Examples: [Tagati Book G](https://github.com/carbeck/tagatibookg)
* Other:
  * [DejaVu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/)
  * [Free Serif](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/)
  * [Tuladha Jejeg](https://sites.google.com/site/jawaunicode/main-page)
