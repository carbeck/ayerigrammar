A Grammar of Ayeri
==================

This is a renewed effort to revise and expand on what's currently on the web as the *Ayeri Grammar* ([PDF](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8026017/Ayeri%20grammar/grammar.pdf)), started in July 2016. I hope that by transferring things to LaTeX, the whole process of editing will become more easy to handle than when I was trying to work with one big document in LibreOffice before. If you feel inclined to do so, you can report issues as Issues.

Table of Contents
=================

**WARNING**: This is work heavily in progress! The table of contents encompasses the following topics so far:

1. Phonology
   1. Phoneme Inventory
