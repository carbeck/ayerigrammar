A Grammar of Ayeri
==================

This is a renewed effort to revise and expand on what's currently on the web as the *Ayeri Grammar* ([PDF](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8026017/Ayeri%20grammar/grammar.pdf)), started in July 2016. I hope that by transferring things to LaTeX, the whole process of editing will become more easy to handle than when I was trying to work with one big document in LibreOffice before. If you feel inclined to do so, you can report issues as Issues.

Table of Contents
=================

**WARNING**: This is work heavily in progress! The table of contents encompasses the following topics so far:

1. Phonology
   1. Phoneme Inventory
   2. Phonotactics
   3. Notes on Prosody
2. Writing System
3. Morphological Typology
4. Grammatical Categories
   1. Nouns

Currently working on:

* Grammatical Categories
  2. Pronouns

  

The sections not currently worked on have been proofread once by myself (I am not a native English speaker). They should already provide useful information, but I will still make slight changes every now and then if I notice something to be wrong.

Compiling
=========

Compile with `xelatex`, `biber`, `makeindex` and `makeglossaries`, or use `arara`. A standard TeXLive 2015 installation should bring all package dependencies. Fonts used:
